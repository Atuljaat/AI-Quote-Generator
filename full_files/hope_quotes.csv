61,"TO BE HOPEFUL in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.
What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places—and there are so many—where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction.
And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.",Howard Zinn,"hope, optimism",1612

You have done what you could.
Some blunders and absurdities, no doubt crept in.
Forget them as soon as you can, tomorrow is a new day;
begin it well and serenely, with too high a spirit

81,"Yes, I decided, a man can truly change. The events of the past year have taught me much about myself, and a few universal truths. I learned, for instance, that while wounds can be inflicted easily upon those we love, it's often much more difficult to heal them. Yet the process of healing those wounds provided the richest experience of my life, leading me to believe that while I've often overestimated what I could accomplish in a day, I had underestimated what I could do in a year.

86,"A Dream Within A Dream

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow-
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand-
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep- while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?","Edgar Allen Poe,","dreams, hope, poetry",896

Like shipwrecked sailors, she turned despairing eyes upon the solitude of her life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of the horizon. She did not know what this chance would be, what wind would bring it her, towards what shore it would drive her, if it would be a shallop or a three-decker, laden with anguish or full of bliss to the portholes.

130,"...But the Mahommedan religion increases, instead of lessening, the fury of intolerance. It was originally propagated by the sword, and ever since, its votaries have been subject, above the people of all other creeds, to this form of madness. In a moment the fruits of patient toil, the prospects of material prosperity, the fear of death itself, are flung aside. The more emotional Pathans are powerless to resist. All rational considerations are forgotten. Seizing their weapons, they become Ghazis—as dangerous and as sensible as mad dogs: fit only to be treated as such. While the more generous spirits among the tribesmen become convulsed in an ecstasy of religious bloodthirstiness, poorer and more material souls derive additional impulses from the influence of others, the hopes of plunder and the joy of fighting. Thus whole nations are roused to arms. Thus the Turks repel their enemies, the Arabs of the Soudan break the British squares, and the rising on the Indian frontier spreads far and wide. In each case civilisation is confronted with militant Mahommedanism. The forces of progress clash with those of reaction.

If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or to be unthankful for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that country and to help others to do the same.","C.S.

When we hit 35,000 feet we’ll have reached the tropopause, the great belt of calm air, as close as I’ll ever get to the ozone. I dreamed we were there. The plane leapt the tropopause, the safe air, and attained the outer rim, the ozone, which was ragged and torn, patches of it threadbare as old cheesecloth, and that was frightening. But I saw something that only I could see because of my astonishing ability to see such things: Souls were rising, from the earth far below, souls of the dead, of people who had perished, from famine, from war, from the plague, and they floated up, like skydivers in reverse, limbs all akimbo, wheeling and spinning. And the souls of these departed joined hands, clasped ankles, and formed a web, a great net of souls, and the souls were three-atom oxygen molecules of the stuff of ozone, and the outer rim absorbed them and was repaired. Nothing’s lost forever. In this world, there’s a kind of painful progress. Longing for what we’ve left behind, and dreaming ahead. At least I think that’s so.","Tony Kushner,",hope,277

He walked past the couch to the open window and held up the drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural objects.

""There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as religion,"" said he, leaning with his back against the shutters. ""It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers, our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra.

Work with your mind sharp and eyes focused and if any thoughts of worries or hate or sadness creep their ways around, shake them off like a runner in the night for you own your mind, and you need to tame it. Focus. Keep it sharp on track, nothing but the task in front of you.
Work until your eyes are tired and head is heavy, and keep working even after that.

These are grounds of hope for others. For ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them.

It comes from something deeper than that, a truer and purer source—harder to tap, harder to keep, but ultimately more elegant, more powerful. My magic. That was at the heart of me. It was a manifestation of what I believed, what I lived. It came from my desire to see to it that someone stood between the darkness and the people it would devour. It came from my love of a good steak, from the way I would sometimes cry at a good movie or a moving symphony. From my life. From the hope that I could make things better for someone else, if not always for me.

481,"Sometimes when I meet old friends, it reminds me how quickly time passes. And it makes me wonder if we've utilized our time properly or not. Proper utilization of time is so important. While we have this body, and especially this amazing human brain, I think every minute is something precious. Our day-to-day existence is very much alive with hope, although there is no guarantee of our future. There is no guarantee that tomorrow at this time we will be here. But we are working for that purely on the basis of hope. So, we need to make the best use of our time. I believe that the proper utilization of time is this: if you can, serve other people, other sentient beings. If not, at least refrain from harming them. I think that is the whole basis of my philosophy.

So, let us reflect what is truly of value in life, what gives meaning to our lives, and set our priorities on the basis of that. The purpose of our life needs to be positive. We weren't born with the purpose of causing trouble, harming others. For our life to be of value, I think we must develop basic good human qualities—warmth, kindness, compassion. Then our life becomes meaningful and more peaceful—happier.","Dalai Lama XIV,","compassion, happiness, hope, positivity, time",113

The more futile, the more useless, the more irrelevant and incomprehensible an act of rebellion is, the vaster and more potent hope becomes.
Hope never makes sense. Hope is weak, unorganized and absurd. Hope, which is always nonviolent, exposes in its powerlessness, the lies, fraud and coercion employed by the state. Hope knows that an injustice visited on our neighbor is an injustice visited on all of us. Hope posits that people are drawn to the good by the good. This is the secret of hope's power. Hope demands for others what we demand for ourselves. Hope does not separate us from them. Hope sees in our enemy our own face.",Chris Hedges,hope,85

Then the reverend proceeded cautiously as he introduced my mom. “Let metell y’all about my Ms. Liza. Sister Kathy kept this one close.”

hint!” For a brief moment, modest laughter filled the church. Yet, it was needed because Pastor Keith had gone into uncharted waters. No one dared to challenge my mom. Yet, Pastor Keith was speaking glowingly about her. Only a fewwanted to see where the Reverend was going. But most didn’t care to re-open that door.

I looked for that which is not, nor can be,
And hope deferred made my heart sick in truth
But years must pass before a hope of youth
Is resigned utterly.

I watched and waited with a steadfast will:
And though the object seemed to flee away
That I so longed for, ever day by day
I watched and waited still.

Sometimes I said: This thing shall be no more;
My expectation wearies and shall cease;
I will resign it now and be at peace:
Yet never gave it o'er.

Sometimes I said: It is an empty name
I long for; to a name why should I give
The peace of all the days I have to live?--
Yet gave it all the same.

But the cross isn't the end. Jesus didn't escape from death; he conquered it and opened the way to heaven for all who will dare to believe. The truth of this moment, if we let it sweep over us, is stunning. It means Jesus really is who he claimed to be, we are really as lost as he said we are, and he really is the only way for us to intimately and spiritually connect with God again.","Steven James,","cross, death, easter, god, hope, jesus, spiritual",74

551,"[Greens] don't come through the back door the same as other groceries. They don't cower at the bottom of paper bags marked 'Liberty.' They wave over the top. They don't stop to be checked off the receipt. They spill out onto the counter. No going onto shelves with cans in orderly lines like school children waiting for recess. No waiting, sometimes for years beyond the blue sell by date, to be picked up and taken from the shelf. Greens don't stack or stand at attention. They aren't peas to be pushed around. Cans can't contain them. Boxed in they would burst free. Greens are wild. Plunging them into a pot took some doing. Only lobsters fight more. Either way, you have to use your hands. Then, retrieving them requires the longest of my mother's wooden spoons, the one with the burnt end.

552,"At such moments the collapse of their courage, willpower, and endurance was so abrupt that they felt they could never drag themselves out of the pit of despond into which they had fallen. Therefore they forced themselves never to think about the problematic day of escape, to cease looking to the future, and always to keep, so to speak, their eyes fixed on the ground at their feet. But, naturally enough, this prudence, this habit of feinting with their predicament and refusing to put up a fight, was ill rewarded. For, while averting that revulsion which they found so unbearable, they also deprived themselves of those redeeming moments, frequent enough when all is told, when by conjuring up pictures of a reunion to be, they could forget about the plague. Thus, in a middle course between these heights and depths, they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have acquired substance only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress.","Camus Albert,","drifting, future, hope, numbness, pain, shadows, suffering",58

555,"A truly Christian love, either to God or men, is a humble broken-hearted love. The desires of the saints, however earnest, are humble desires. Their hope is a humble hope; and their joy, even when it is unspeakable and full of glory, is a humble broken-hearted joy, and leaves the Christian more poor in spirit, and more like a little child, and more disposed to a universal lowliness of behaviour.","Jonathan Edwards,","hope, humility, joy, love, poor-in-spirit",51

Well, but how could I just stop there? Those words were worse than nothing if I didn't tell what they meant to Grandpa. Looking at the long rough box, I spoke timid, in a mumbled voice. Not preachified at all. ""Grandpa didn't think Jesus meant, by that, that we should ast God for things, or for special favors. He said we could trust that in the nature of things, without astin', we'll get lots of blessin's and happy surprises and maybe a miracle or two. When Jesus said ast and you'll get it, He meant things of the spirit, not the flesh. Right now for instance, I could ast, 'Lord please raise Grandpa from the dead,' but it wouldn't happen. But I can say, 'Please, God, comfort me,' and I'll get heart's ease. Grandpa said Jesus meant us to ast for hope, forgiveness, and all that. Ast, 'Hep us not be scared, hep us not be greedy, give us courage to try."" I was really carried away. ""Ast any such and God will give it to you. But don't ast Him not to let fire burn, or say spare me from death. At least, uh, that's what Grandpa said.","Olive Ann Burns,","faith, god, hope",46

586,"A Brief for the Defense

Sorrow everywhere. Slaughter everywhere. If babies
are not starving someplace, they are starving
somewhere else. With flies in their nostrils.
But we enjoy our lives because that's what God wants.
Otherwise the mornings before summer dawn would not
be made so fine. The Bengal tiger would not
be fashioned so miraculously well. The poor women
at the fountain are laughing together between
the suffering they have known and the awfulness
in their future, smiling and laughing while somebody
in the village is very sick. There is laughter
every day in the terrible streets of Calcutta,
and the women laugh in the cages of Bombay.
If we deny our happiness, resist our satisfaction,
we lessen the importance of their deprivation.
We must risk delight. We can do without pleasure,
but not delight. Not enjoyment. We must have
the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless
furnace of this world. To make injustice the only
measure of our attention is to praise the Devil.
If the locomotive of the Lord runs us down,
we should give thanks that the end had magnitude.
We must admit there will be music despite everything.
We stand at the prow again of a small ship
anchored late at night in the tiny port
looking over to the sleeping island: the waterfront
is three shuttered cafés and one naked light burning.
To hear the faint sound of oars in the silence as a rowboat
comes slowly out and then goes back is truly worth
all the years of sorrow that are to come.","Jack Gilbert,","god, happiness, hope, joy, sorrow, suffering",49

The reason is that as long as the human body is not free from suffering, mind cannot be happy.
If a man lacks enthusiasm, either his body or mind is in a deceased condition....

Now what saps the enthusiasm in man?
If there is no enthusiasm, life becomes drudgery - a mere burden to be dragged. Nothing can be achieved if there is no enthusiasm.
The main reason for this lack of enthusiasm on the part of a man is that an individual looses the hope of getting an opportunity to elevate himself.
Hopelessness leads to lack of enthusiasm.
The mind in such cases becomes deceased....

When one breaths an atmosphere where one is sure of getting the legitimate reward for one's labor, only then one feels enriched by enthusiasm and inspiration.","Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar,","enthusiasm, hope, hopelessness, human-body, inspirational-quotes, mind, suffering",33

As such, an optimist always sees the big picture. How else to keep track of all that’s out there? An optimist is simply a proactive realist.

An idealist focuses only on the best aspects of all things (sometimes in detriment to reality); an optimist strives to find an effective solution. A pessimist sees limited or no choices in dark times; an optimist makes choices.

When bobbing for apples, an idealist endlessly reaches for the best apple, a pessimist settles for the first one within reach, while an optimist drains the barrel, fishes out all the apples and makes pie.

766,"Dickens has not seen it all. The wretched of the earth do not decide to become extinct, they resolve, on the contrary, to multiply: life is their only weapon against life, life is all that they have. This is why the dispossessed and starving will never be convinced (though some may be coerced) by the population-control programs of the civilized. I have watched the dispossessed and starving laboring in the fields which others own, with their transistor radios at their ear, all day long: so they learn, for example, along with equally weighty matters, that the pope, one of the heads of the civilized world, forbids to the civilized that abortion which is being, literally, forced on them, the wretched. The civilized have created the wretched, quite coldly and deliberately, and do not intend to change the status quo; are responsible for their slaughter and enslavement; rain down bombs on defenseless children whenever and wherever they decide that their ‘vital interests’ are menaced, and think nothing of torturing a man to death: these people are not to be taken seriously when they speak of the ‘sanctity’ of human life, or the ‘conscience’ of the civilized world. There is a ‘sanctity’ involved with bringing a child into this world: it is better than bombing one out of it. Dreadful indeed it is to see a starving child, but the answer to that is not to prevent the child’s arrival but to restructure the world so that the child can live in it: so that the ‘vital interest’ of the world becomes nothing less than the life of the child. However—I could not have said any of this then, nor is so absurd a notion about to engulf the world now. But we were all starving children, after all, and none of our fathers, even at their most embittered and enraged, had ever suggested that we ‘die out.’ It was not we who were supposed to die out: this was, of all notions, the most forbidden, and we learned this from the cradle. Every trial, every beating, every drop of blood, every tear, were meant to be used by us for a day that was coming—for a day that was certainly coming, absolutely certainly, certainly coming: not for us, perhaps, but for our children. The children of the despised and rejected are menaced from the moment they stir in the womb, and are therefore sacred in a way that the children of the saved are not. And the children know it, which is how they manage to raise their children, and why they will not be persuaded—by their children’s murderers, after all—to cease having children.","James Baldwin,","hope, important, powerful, profound, revolution",27

782,"The Voyager

We are all lonely voyagers sailing on life's ebb tide,
To a far off place were all stripling warriors have died,
Sometime at eve when the tide is low,
The voices call us back to the rippling water's flow,
Even though our boat sailed with love in our hearts,
Neither our dreams or plans would keep heaven far apart,
We drift through the hush of God's twilight pale,
With no response to our friendly hail,
We raise our sails and search for majestic light,
While finding company on this journey to the brighten our night,
Then suddenly he pulls us through the reef's cutting sea,
Back to the place that he asked us to be,
Friendly barges that were anchored so sweetly near,
In silent sorrow they drop their salted tears,
Shall our soul be a feast of kelp and brine,
The wasted tales of wishful time,
Are we a fish on a line lured with bait,
Is life the grind, a heartless fate,
Suddenly, ""HUSH"", said the wind from afar,
Have you not looked to the heavens and seen the new star,
It danced on the abyss of the evening sky,
The sparkle of heaven shining on high,
Its whisper echoed on the ocean's spray,
From the bow to the mast they heard him say,
""Hope is above, not found in the deep,
I am alive in your memories and dreams when you sleep,
I will greet you at sunset and with the moon's evening smile,
I will light your path home.. every last lonely mile,
My friends, have no fear, my work was done well,
In this life I broke the waves and rode the swell,
I found faith in those that I called my crew,
My love will be the compass that will see you through,
So don't look for me on the ocean's floor to find,
I've never left the weathered docks of your loving mind,
For I am in the moon, the wind and the whale's evening song,

Hope is practised through the virtue of patience, which continues to do good even in the face of apparent failure, and through the virtue of humility, which accepts God's mystery and trusts him even at times of darkness. Faith tells us that God has given his Son for our sakes and gives us the victorious certainty that it is really true: God is love! It thus transforms our impatience and our doubts into the sure hope that God holds the world in his hands and that, as the dramatic imagery of the end of the Book of Revelation points out, in spite of all darkness he ultimately triumphs in glory. Faith, which sees the love of God revealed in the pierced heart of Jesus on the Cross, gives rise to love. Love is the light—and in the end, the only light—that can always illuminate a world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working. Love is possible, and we are able to practise it because we are created in the image of God. To experience love and in this way to cause the light of God to enter into the world—this is the invitation I would like to extend with the present Encyclical.","Pope Benedict XVI (Joseph Ratzinger),","charity, faith, hope, theological-virtues",29

875,"There is magic in this sad, hard world. A magic stronger than fate, stronger than chance. And it is seen in the unlikeliest of places.
By a hearth at night, as a girl leaves a bit of cheese for a hungry mouse.
In a slaughter yard, as the old and infirm, the weak and discarded, are made to matter more than money.
In a poor carpenter's small attic room, where three sisters learned that the price of forgiveness is forgiving.
And now, on a battlefield, as a mere girl tries to turn the red tide of war.
It is the magic of a frail and fallible creature, one capable of both unspeakable cruelty and immense kindness. It lives inside every human being ready to redeem us. To transform us. To save us. If we can only find the courage to listen to it.
It is the magic of the human heart.","Jennifer Donnelly,","battle, hope, human-heart, kindness, love, magic, war, world",43
876,"Eddie saw great things and near misses. Albert Einstein as a child, not quite struck by a run-away milk-wagon as he crossed a street. A teenage boy named Albert Schweitzer getting out of a bathtub and not quite stepping on the cake of soap lying beside the pulled plug. A Nazi Oberleutnant burning a piece of paper with the date and place of the D-Day Invasion written on it. He saw a man who intended to poison the entire water supply of Denver die of a heart attack in a roadside rest-stop on I-80 in Iowa with a bag of McDonald’s French fries on his lap. He saw a terrorist wired up with explosives suddenly turn away from a crowded restaurant in a city that might have been Jerusalem. The terrorist had been transfixed by nothing more than the sky, and the thought that it arced above the just and unjust alike. He saw four men rescue a little boy from a monster whose entire head seemed to consist of a single eye.
But more important than any of these was the vast, accretive weight of small things, from planes which hadn’t crashed to men and women who had come to the correct place at the perfect time and thus founded generations. He saw kisses exchanged in doorways and wallets returned and men who had come to a splitting of the way and chosen the right fork. He saw a thousand random meetings that weren’t random, ten thousand right decisions, a hundred thousand right answers, a million acts of unacknowledged kindness. He saw the old people of River Crossing and Roland kneeling in the dust for Aunt Talitha’s blessing; again heard her giving it freely and gladly. Heard her telling him to lay the cross she had given him at the foot of the Dark Tower and speak the name of Talitha Unwin at the far end of the earth. He saw the Tower itself in the burning folds of the rose and for a moment understood its purpose: how it distributed its lines of force to all the worlds that were and held them steady in time’s great helix. For every brick that landed on the ground instead of some little kid’s head, for every tornado that missed the trailer park, for every missile that didn’t fly, for every hand stayed from violence, there was the Tower.
And the quiet, singing voice of the rose. The song that promised all might be well, all might be well, that all manner of things might be well.","Stephen King,",hope,41

Optimism is a wish without warrant; Christian hope is a certainty, guaranteed by God himself. Optimism reflects ignorance as to whether good things will ever actually come.

As I see it today, the ability to read awoke inside me some long dormant craving to be mentally alive. I certainly wasn’t seeking any degree, the way a college confers a status symbol upon its students. My home made education gave me, with every additional book that I read, a little bit more sensitivity to the deafness, dumbness, and blindness that was afflicting the black race in America. Not long ago, an English writer telephoned me from London asking questions.

In addition to the happiness of being a fighter for the cause of socialism, fate gave me the happiness of being her husband. During the almost forty years of our life together she remained an inexhaustible source of love, magnanimity, and tenderness. She underwent great sufferings, especially in the last period of our lives. But I find some comfort in the fact that she also knew days of happiness.

For forty-three years of my conscious life I have remained a revolutionist; for forty-two of them I have fought under the banner of Marxism. If I had to begin all over again I would of course try to avoid this or that mistake, but the main course of my life would remain unchanged. I shall die a proletarian revolutionist, a Marxist, a dialectical materialist, and, consequently, an irreconcilable atheist. My faith in the communist future of mankind is not less ardent, indeed it is firmer today, than it was in the days of my youth.

956,"Havel had said that people struggling for independence wanted money and recognition from other countries; they wanted more criticism of the Soviet empire from the West and more diplomatic pressure. But Havel had said that these were things they wanted; the only thing they needed was hope. Not that pie in the sky stuff, not a preference for optimism over pessimism, but rather 'an orientation of the spirit.'

Please take away my pain and despair of yesterday and any unpleasant memories and replace them with Your glorious promise of new hope. Show me a fresh HS-inspired way of relating to negative things that have happened. I ask You for the mind of Christ so I can discern Your voice from the voice of my past. I pray that former rejection and deep hurts will not color what I see and hear now.

Help me to see all the choices I have ahead of me that can alter the direction of my life. I ask You to empower me to let go of the painful events and heartaches that would keep me bound. Thank You for Your forgiveness that You have offered to me at such a great price. Pour it into my heart so I can relinquish bitterness hurts and disappointments that have no place in my life. Please set me free to forgive those who have sinned against me and caused me pain and also myself. Open my heart to receive Your complete forgiveness and amazing grace. You have promised to bind up my wounds Psa 147:3 and restore my soul Psa 23:3 .

Help me to relinquish my past surrender to You my present and move to the future You have prepared for me. I ask You to come into my heart and make me who You would have me to be so that I might do Your will here on earth.

On the contrary, a man could be without a doubt lit with the strength, the peace, and the knowledge of the gods, his gods, but when or if the devils grow weary in unsuccessful attempts to torment him, they begin tormenting his loved ones, or, if not his loved ones, anyone who may attempt to grasp his philosophies. No matter how godly he may become, God is, in the end, his only hope and his only grace for the pressures built around him - it is left up to a higher authority and a more solid peace and a wider love to eclipse not just one's own evils but all evils for goodness to ultimately matter. If all men were gods, each being would dwell in a separate prison cell, hopeless, before finally imploding into nothingness.","Criss Jami,","angels, apologetics, bad, badness, demons, devil, ego, evil, faith, god, good, goodness, grace, hope, hopelessness, humility, love, mercy, morality, peace, philosophy, possession, pride, prison, religion, satan, science, security, sin, spirit-realm, spirits, spiritual, spirituality",16

And she turned her face away!

Still, in strife, she whispered peace;
She would sing while I was weeping;
If I listened, she would cease.

False she was, and unrelenting;
When my last joys strewed the ground,
Even Sorrow saw, repenting,
Those sad relics scattered round;

Hope, whose whisper would have given
Balm to all my frenzied pain,
Stretched her wings, and soared to heaven,

1143,"I would like [my readers] to better understand human beings and human life as a result of having read [my] stories. I'd like them to feel that this was an experience that made things better for them and an experience that gave them hope. I think that the kind of things that we talk about at this conference -- fantasy very much so, science fiction, and even horror -- the message that we're sending is the reverse of the message sent by what is called ""realistic fiction."" (I happen to think that realistic fiction is not, in fact, realistic, but that's a side issue.) And what we are saying is that it doesn't have to be like this: things can be different. Our society can be changed. Maybe it's worse, maybe it's better. Maybe it's a higher civilization, maybe it's a barbaric civilization. But it doesn't have to be the way it is now. Things can change. And we're also saying things can change for you in your life. Look at the difference between Severian the apprentice and Severian the Autarch [in The Book of the New Sun], for example. The difference beteween Silk as an augur and Silk as calde [in The Book of the Long Sun]. You see?

We don't always have to be this. There can be something else. We can stop doing the thing that we're doing. Moms Mabley had a great line in some movie or other -- she said, ""You keep on doing what you been doing and you're gonna keep on gettin' what you been gettin'."" And we don't have to keep on doing what we've been doing. We can do something else if we don't like what we're gettin'.

1238,"Four times during the first six days they were assembled and briefed and then sent back. Once, they took off and were flying in formation when the control tower summoned them down. The more it rained, the worse they suffered. The worse they suffered, the more they prayed that it would continue raining. All through the night, men looked at the sky and were saddened by the stars. All through the day, they looked at the bomb line on the big, wobbling easel map of Italy that blew over in the wind and was dragged in under the awning of the intelligence tent every time the rain began. The bomb line was a scarlet band of narrow satin ribbon that delineated the forward most position of the Allied ground forces in every sector of the Italian mainland.

For hours they stared relentlessly at the scarlet ribbon on the map and hated it because it would not move up high enough to encompass the city.

When night fell, they congregated in the darkness with flashlights, continuing their macabre vigil at the bomb line in brooding entreaty as though hoping to move the ribbon up by the collective weight of their sullen prayers. ""I really can't believe it,"" Clevinger exclaimed to Yossarian in a voice rising and falling in protest and wonder. ""It's a complete reversion to primitive superstition. They're confusing cause and effect. It makes as much sense as knocking on wood or crossing your fingers. They really believe that we wouldn't have to fly that mission tomorrow if someone would only tiptoe up to the map in the middle of the night and move the bomb line over Bologna. Can you imagine?

It means taking responsibility for the character of the human world. That's a real confrontation with the problem of value. In short, refusal of the present is a return to what Thoreau and Ruskin called ""human fundamentals, valuable things,"" and it is a movement into the future. This movement into the future is also a powerful expression of that most human spiritual emotion, Hope.

1261,"Glossa

Time goes by, time comes along,
All is old and all is new;
What is right and what is wrong,
You must think and ask of you;
Have no hope and have no fear,
Waves that rise can never hold;
If they urge or if they cheer,
You remain aloof and cold.

To our sight a lot will glisten,
Many sounds will reach our ear;
Who could take the time to listen
And remember all we hear?
Keep aside from all that patter,
Seek yourself, far from the throng
When with loud and idle clatter
Time goes by, time comes along.

Nor forget the tongue of reason
Or its even scales depress
When the moment, changing season,
Wears the mask of happiness -
It is born of reason's slumber
And may last a wink as true:
For the one who knows its number
All is old and all is new.

Be as to a play, spectator,
As the world unfolds before:
You will know the heart of matter
Should they act two parts or four;
When they cry or tear asunder
From your seat enjoy along
And you'll learn from art to wonder
What is right and what is wrong.

Past and future, ever blending,
Are the twin sides of same page:
New start will begin with ending
When you know to learn from age;
All that was or be tomorrow
We have in the present, too;
But what's vain and futile sorrow
You must think and ask of you;


For the living cannot sever
From the means we've always had:
Now, as years ago, and ever,
Men are happy or are sad:
Other masks, same play repeated;
Diff'rent tongues, same words to hear;
Of your dreams so often cheated,
Have no hope and have no fear.

Hope not when the villains cluster
By success and glory drawn:
Fools with perfect lack of luster
Will outshine Hyperion!
Fear it not, they'll push each other
To reach higher in the fold,
Do not side with them as brother,
Waves that rise can never hold.

Sounds of siren songs call steady
Toward golden nets, astray;
Life attracts you into eddies
To change actors in the play;
Steal aside from crowd and bustle,
Do not look, seem not to hear
From your path, away from hustle,
If they urge or if they cheer;

If they reach for you, go faster,
Hold your tongue when slanders yell;
Your advice they cannot master,
Don't you know their measure well?
Let them talk and let them chatter,
Let all go past, young and old;
Unattached to man or matter,
You remain aloof and cold.

You remain aloof and cold
If they urge or if they cheer;
Waves that rise can never hold,
Have no hope and have no fear;
You must think and ask of you
What is right and what is wrong;
All is old and all is new,
Time goes by, time comes along.","Mihai Eminescu,","adrian-g-sahlean, aloof, cold, fear, glossa, hope, mihai-eminescu, new, old, poems, poetry, poetry-quotes, poezii, right, think, time, wrong",17

1263,"I wanted, for so long, for someone to understand me better than I understood myself, to take control of me, to save me, to make it all better. I thought that the hardest part of a loving, mutually healing relationship would be showing my vulnerable, raw spots to a person, even though I'd been hurt so many times before. This has not been the hardest part. The actual hardest part has been realizing that no one, no matter how compassionate and kind they are, will say the perfect things always. Myself included. The hardest part has been learning to communicate what I need, to hear what others need, to tell others how to tell me what they need. Intimacy takes a lot of communication. We all have triggers. I don't know your triggers and you don't know mine. No matter how much I love or trust you, you cannot possibly know exactly the words I need to hear, the words I don't want to hear, and the way I like to be touched. And how strange that we expect these things of each other. How strange, and self-sabotaging, that we refuse to get into relationships and friendships with people unless they treat us in just that perfect way. We've been raised to want fairy tales. We've been raised to wait for flawless saviors to rescue us. But the savior isn't flawless and the savior is not coming. The savior is you. The savior is still learning. The savior is never done learning. The savior is a human being. Forget perfect. Forget flawless. And start speaking your truth. Start speaking what you want and how you want it. And start asking and listening, really listening, to what the people around you say. Maybe, then, we will stop abandoning and hurting each other.

Oh, Hope! thou soother sweet of human woes!
How shall I lure thee to my haunts forlorn!
For me wilt thou renew the wither’d rose,
And clear my painful path of pointed thorn?
Ah come, sweet nymph! in smiles and softness drest,
Like the young hours that lead the tender year,
Enchantress! come, and charm my cares to rest:—
Alas! the flatterer flies, and will not hear!
A prey to fear, anxiety, and pain,
Must I a sad existence still deplore?
Lo!—the flowers fade, but all the thorns remain,

It has covered the cheeks of this world with tears. It has polluted the hearts of children, and poisoned the imaginations of men. It has been a constant pain, a perpetual terror to every good man and woman and child. It has filled the good with horror and with fear; but it has had no effect upon the infamous and base. It has wrung the hearts of the tender; it has furrowed the cheeks of the good. This doctrine never should be preached again. What right have you, sir, Mr. clergyman, you, minister of the gospel, to stand at the portals of the tomb, at the vestibule of eternity, and fill the future with horror and with fear?

1320,"Even after centuries of human interacting, children still continue to rebel against their parents and siblings. Young marrieds look upon their in-laws and parents as obstacles to their independence and growth. Parents view their children as selfish ingrates. Husbands desert their wives and seek greener fields elsewhere. Wives form relationships with heroes of soap operas who vicariously bring excitement and romance into their empty lives. Workers often hate their bosses and co-workers and spend miserable hours with them, day after day. On a larger scale, management cannot relate with labour. Each accuses the other of unreasonable self-interests and narrow-mindedness. Religious groups often become entrapped, each in a provincial dogma resulting in hate and vindictiveness in the name of God. Nations battle blindly, under the shadow of the world annihilation, for the realization of their personal rights. Members of these groups blame rival groups for their continual sense of frustration, impotence, lack of progress and communication. We have obviously not learned much over the years. We have not paused long enough to consider the simple truth that we humans are not born with particular attitudinal sets regarding other persons, we are taught into them. We are the future generation's teachers. We are, therefore, the perpetrators of the confusion and alienation we abhor and which keeps us impotent in finding new alternatives. It is up to us to diligently discover new solutions and learn new patterns of relating, ways more conducive to growth, peace, hope and loving coexistence.

Was this the legacy we would leave our children, a level of anxiety and self-doubt not seen since our simian ancestors cowered in the tallest trees? What kind of world would they rebuild? Would they rebuild at all? Could they continue to progress, knowing that they would be powerless to reclaim their future? And what if that future saw another rise of the living dead? Would our descendants rise to meet them in battle, or simply crumple in meek surrender and accept what they believe to be their inevitable extinction? For this alone, we had to reclaim our planet. We had to prove to ourselves that we could do it, and leave that proof as this war's greatest monument. The long, hard road back to humanity, or the regressive ennui of Earth's once-proud primates.

1461,"One factor that makes human being reluctant to have hope is the fear of disappointment.
Do not be afraid of disappointment! The more you afraid of it, the smaller your expectation.
Face and overcome the disappointment, even though it felt bitter in soul and pain in body.
If you go through and pass it, then your soul and body will be stronger than previous level.
When hope emerged, change will occur because of that, both in your soul and in your body.
Fear of disapointment is a main enemy of good hope and great change within the human being.
Only by facing and overcoming the fear of disapointment, man will become stronger and wiser.
~
Salah satu faktor yang membuat manusia enggan untuk berharap adalah rasa takut akan kecewa.
Jangan takut dengan kekecewaan! Semakin engkau takut menghadapinya, semakin kecil pengharapanmu.
Hadapi dan lawanlah rasa kecewa, meskipun terasa pahit di jiwa dan terasa sakit di tubuh.
Jika engkau mampu dan lulus, maka jiwa dan tubuhmu akan lebih kuat dari kondisi sebelumnya.
Ketika harapan muncul, perubahan akan terjadi, baik dalam jiwa maupun dalam tubuh manusia.
Rasa takut akan kecewa adalah musuh utama pengharapan yang baik dan perubahan yang agung dalam diri manusia.
Hanya dengan menghadapi dan melalui rasa takut akan kecewa, seseorang dapat menjadi lebih kuat dan bijaksana.","Toba Beta,","change, disapointment, fear, hope",8

Fowler) Wright, Orwell, Taine, Temple, Gernsback, Campbell and other seminal influences in scientifiction, I regret the lack of any female writers but only Radclyffe Hall opened my eyes outside sci-fi.

I was a secular humanist before I knew the term. I have not believed in God since childhood's end. I believe a belief in any deity is adolescent, shameful and dangerous. How would you feel, surrounded by billions of human beings taking Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the tooth fairy and the stork seriously, and capable of shaming, maiming or murdering in their name? I am embarrassed to live in a world retaining any faith in church, prayer or a celestial creator. I do not believe in Heaven, Hell or a Hereafter; in angels, demons, ghosts, goblins, the Devil, vampires, ghouls, zombies, witches, warlocks, UFOs or other delusions; and in very few mundane individuals--politicians, lawyers, judges, priests, militarists, censors and just plain people. I respect the individual's right to abortion, suicide and euthanasia. I support birth control. I wish to Good that society were rid of smoking, drinking and drugs.

My hope for humanity - and I think sensible science fiction has a beneficial influence in this direction - is that one day everyone born will be whole in body and brain, will live a long life free from physical and emotional pain, will participate in a fulfilling way in their contribution to existence, will enjoy true love and friendship, will pity us 20th century barbarians who lived and died in an atrocious, anachronistic atmosphere of arson, rape, robbery, kidnapping, child abuse, insanity, murder, terrorism, war, smog, pollution, starvation and the other negative “norms” of our current civilization.

Tell Him all you learned today.
Say the things you need to say.

Beg forgiveness for your sins.
Pray to live with Him again.
Speak with earnest heart and soul.
He will listen. This I know.

For prayer is hope put to the test.
And hope is faith in what is best.
Faith is power to do great things.
Thus, prayer is faith's enabling wings.","Richelle E. Goodrich,","ask, faith, god, hope, pray, prayer, richelle, richelle-e-goodrich, richelle-goodrich",9

It is this; however fashionable despair about the world and about people may be at present, and however powerful despair may become in the future, not everybody, or even most people, think and live fashionably; virtue and honour will not be banished from the world, however many popular moralists and panicky journalists say so. Sacrifice will not cease to be because psychiatrists have popularized the idea that there is often some concealed, self-serving element in it; theologians always knew that. Nor do I think love as a high condition of honour will be lost; it is a pattern in the spirit, and people long to make the pattern a reality in their own lives, whatever means they take to do so. In short, Davey, God is not dead. And I can assure you God is not mocked.","Robertson Davies,","despair, honour, hope, morality, virtue",8

the way my mother was lost in it for a while

And then, with her eyes closed, my mother said
the one or two words the living have for gratefulness,
which is a kind of forgetting, with a sense
of what it means to be alive long enough
to love someone. Thank you, she said. As for me,

When you're disenfranchised and you don't have any opportunities for education and other businesses, you have to focus on civil rights. Now we're at a moment where we are in the beginnings of a narrative struggle. The reason why I'm hopeful is that earlier, even in my career, we didn't have thousands of committed journalists and professionals and storytellers and filmmakers and writers who could participate in this narrative structure.

1697,"We have a collection of 800 jars of soil in our museum. We collect these soils from lynching sites. People who are involved in erecting markers collect the soil, put it in a jar that has the name of the victim, the date of the victim, and then they bring it back to the museum.

An older Black woman was digging soil at a site in west Alabama. She was afraid because it was on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. As she was about to dig, a big white man in a pickup truck drove by and stared at her. It made her anxious. Then he drove by again and stared some more. Then he parked his truck, got out, and walked toward her. She was terrified. Then the man asked, ""What are you doing?"" She was going to tell him that she was just getting dirt for her garden. Then she said, ""Mr. Stevenson, something got ahold of me. I told that man, I'm digging soil here because this is where a Black man was lynched in 1937."" She just looked down and started digging.

The man surprised her by asking, ""Does that memo you have talk about the lynching?"" She said, ""It does."" Then he asked, ""Can I read it?"" He started reading while she started digging. After he finished reading the memo, he said, ""Would it be all right if I helped you?"" She said, ""Yes."" The man got down on his knees, and she offered him the implement to dig the soil. He said, ""No, no, no, no, no, you keep that. I'll just use my hands."" She said he started picking up the soil and putting it in the jar, and throwing his hand into the soil. She said there was something about the conviction with which he was putting his whole body into this that moved her.

She went from fear to relief to joy so quickly she couldn't help it. Tears were running down her face. The man turned to her and he said, ""Oh, ma'am, I'm so sorry I'm upsetting you."" She said, ""No, no, no. You're blessing me."" They kept digging, and they were getting near to filling the jar. She looked over at the man, and she noticed that he had slowed down. His face had turned red. Then she saw that there was a tear running down his face. She reached over and put her hand on his shoulder. She said, ""Are you all right?"" That's when the man turned her, and he said, ""No, ma'am."" He said, ""I'm just so worried that it might have been my grandfather who helped lynch this man.""

She said they both sat on that roadside and wept. She said, I'm going to go back and put this jar of soil in the museum in Montgomery. Then the man said, ""Ma'am, would it be all right if I just followed you back?"" She said, ""Sure."" She called me on the way back. She said, ""Mr. Stevenson, I want you to come to the museum and meet my new friend."" I was there when these two people who met on a roadside in a place of pain and agony and violence and bigotry came in and together did something beautiful by putting that jar of soil in that exhibit.

I'm not naive. I don't believe that beautiful things like that always happen when we tell the truth. I do believe that we deny ourselves the beauty of justice when we refuse to tell the truth. I've seen too much beauty come out of truth-telling, too much restoration, too much redemption, to believe that truth-telling doesn't have a power that is greater than the fear and anger that is prompting these orders, prompting some of this retreat. I worry about people who are already surrendering and waving white flags, and running for cover.

And it shatters them completely, into one million pieces, and it seems like there is no coming back. It’s over. But in time they put themselves together piece by piece. And the thing is, when they do that, they often find that they are a different person, a changed, more complete, more realized, more clearly drawn person.

Sundial straight, I strode onshore,
Waves pulsing like a foetal lullaby,
Canine companion nestling my knee,
A chef's kiss-of-life breathing space.

Looking glass shimmer at the cliff's base,
Tranquility’s wellspring beneath my feet,
Sanctum of meditation, a paused life retreat,
My seagull eyewitnesses hovering above.

The seclusion sought yielded rewards,
A hit of joie de vivre in its purest form,
The sky’s spotlight and the humid wind,
Senses alive with the lapping, busy tide.

Nascent cloud veils gather at magic hour,
Amber inferno, foretaste of paradise,
Welcomed, savoured, and appreciated,
Driftwood floating home on sunset waters.

Fen looks surprised by this.

“I loved a landscape and watched it burn,” I say. “This island, you can see what it will look like, there’s a film over everything. You can see it disappearing. There’s no stable ground. Not here. Not anywhere else.”

“And you’d want to try and survive all of that on your own?” she asks.

“What that instability does to relationships—what constant danger does to them—is devastating. It’s unraveling.”

I can see she doesn’t believe me but I don’t push the point. She will see, one day. Loving a place is the same as having a child. They are both too much an act of hope, of defiance. And those are a fool’s weapons.","Charlotte McConaghy,","climate-change, grief-and-loss, hope, love",1

I’m happy, so happy to be a tiny fleck of a thing alongside you. We may just be moments, June, but to love a handful of people very well, that’s a good life.

I was just a blip, a spark, the blink of God’s eyes. Because of you, it was more than enough. It was everything.

1748,"And for the first time, I distance myself from the personal tragedy that has consumed me since they announced the Quell. I remember the old man they shot in District 11, and Bonnie and Twill, and the rumoured uprisings. Yes, everyone in the districts will be watching me to see how I handle this death sentence, this final act of President Snow's dominance. They will be looking for some sign that their battles have not been in vain. If I can make it clear that I'm still defying the Capitol right up to the end, the Capitol will have killed me...but not my spirit. What better way to give hope to the rebels?

The beauty of this idea is that my decision to keep Peeta alive at the expense of my own life is itself an act of defiance. A refusal to play the Hunger Games by the Capitol's rules. My private agenda dovetails completely with my public one. And if I really could save Peeta... in terms of a revolution, this would be ideal. Because I will be more valuable dead. They can turn me into some kind of martyr for the cause and paint my face on banners, and it will do more to rally people than anything I could do if I was living. But Peeta would be more valuable alive, and tragic, because he will be able to turn his pain into words that will transform people.","Suzanne Collins,","defiance, hope, inspirational, katniss-everdeen, rebellion, revolution, tragic",0

1768,"Wittgenstein wrote a comprehensive critique of the Scottish anthropologist J. G. Frazer's masterpiece ""The Golden Bough"" (1890), a comparative study of religion and mythology. One of Wittgenstein's main objections was that Frazer ascribes the natives he discusses with irrational beliefs for which there is no evidence: for example, that a certain ritual will make it rain. The problem is that Frazer is unable to see what the natives are actually doing. Wittgenstein states: ""Frazer is much more savage than most of his savages... His explanations of primitive practices are much cruder than the meaning of these practices themselves."" While Frazer believes that the natives' actions are based on mistaken beliefs about causal relationships, Wittgenstein suggests that they are not based on such beliefs at all.

Once, after a very bad game, I smashed my tennis racket. Had my opponent thought like Frazer, he would have believed that my action was a ritual sacrifice aimed at changing the outcome of the tournament for me. But my action was not based on any such expectation. It was simply an immature expression of anger and disappointment. The most reasonable understanding of the natives' ritual practices involves considering them as expressions of hope, among other things, not as irrational notions of causal relationships. Our idea of causation stems from us observing regularities. We will have repeatedly seen that A is followed by B. What regularities would have led the natives to see a causal relationship between a specific ritual and a specific natural phenomenon such as rain? Is is unlikely that rain was usually brought about by a specific dance, and the natives must have seen that it sometimes rains despite no ritual being performed. Not least, the natives should have danced a lot during the driest parts of the year, but they didn't. So it's far more plausible to consider this dance an expression of hoping for rain. From that perspective there is nothing irrational about the natives' actions. The dancing is a shared expression of their understanding that the desired rain might come.","Lars Svendsen,","anthropology, hope, philosophy, ritual",0

You can Never allow yourself to hear anything negative, even minutely disgraceful about them, no matter how many insults they might have pulled your way. No, you can silently walk away, but you would never want to hear anything wrong being said about them, in fact you would stand first to leave the room when such a thing happen or maybe fight fiercely for them simply because your heart wouldn't allow it no matter how much your mind might argue otherwise.
And even when your Hurt runs deep, even when the wounds won't ever stop bleeding, even when you might never have received even a fraction of what you gave, you would still give in a way that is beyond any logic, you would give in the virtue of Grace and Dignity in knowing that Love can Never be turned in Hate, yes when you Love someone Immensely, it might sometimes turn into Hate, but when You Loved Someone with all the Hopes and Dreams of a Home, even when the Home breaks, you still hold on to the foundations with a Grace that Only God Understands.

Hope is critical to both faith and charity. When disobedience, disappointment, and procrastination erode faith, hope is there to uphold our faith. When frustration and impatience challenge charity, hope braces our resolve and urges us to care for our neighbors even without expectation of reward. The brighter our hope, the greater our faith.

1840,"Unspoken Sonata by Stewart Stafford

Love's lullaby's unheard duet,
Kisses of life drown shallow opinions,
Prejudged by logic, yet set apart,
Our oasis bars the negative legions.

Eternal tongues of a mother lode;
Looks of love, a second-sight ploy,
To visions beyond earthly interpretation;
Dance down darkest paths to ecstatic joy.

Spoiler seers nix romantic ideals;
Abyssal agendas in jealousy's biome,
A caterpillar doxxed for its butterfly shape,
Real love's navigator guides us home.

1843,"A Mother Steeled by Stewart Stafford

A haunted mother in despair's glade,
That echoed with her feral screams,
Sifting through tiny bones for reasons,
Catharsis an absent but invited guest.

Healed knees, once bloody, kneel,
Cobwebs wiped, storm damage fixed,
Bittersweet, her baby has taken wing,
His bruises, all of him, now flown above.

Daybreak's star field on the final vigil,
Dropping the self-flagellation whip,
Fragment memories of her infant taken,
Striding forth, her scars a living map.

1845,"There is a certain grief in things as they are, in man as he has come to be, as he certainly is, over and above those griefs of circumstance which are in a measure removable—some inexplicable shortcoming, or misadventure, on the part of nature itself—death, and old age as it must needs be, and that watching for their approach, which makes every stage of life like a dying over and over again. Almost all death is painful, and in every thing that comes to an end a touch of death, and therefore of wretched coldness struck home to one, of remorse, of loss and parting, of outraged attachments. Given faultless men and women, given a perfect state of society which should have no need to practise on men’s susceptibilities for its own selfish ends, adding one turn more to the wheel of the great rack for its own interest or amusement, there would still be this evil in the world, of a certain necessary sorrow and desolation, felt, just in proportion to the moral, or nervous perfection men have attained to. And what we need in the world, over against that, is a certain permanent and general power of compassion—humanity’s standing force of self-pity—as an elementary ingredient of our social atmosphere, if we are to live in it at all. I wonder, sometimes, in what way man has cajoled himself into the bearing of his burden thus far, seeing how every step in the capacity of apprehension his labour has won for him, from age to age, must needs increase his dejection. It is as if the increase of knowledge were but an increasing revelation of the radical hopelessness of his position: and I would that there were one even as I, behind this vain show of things!","Walter Pater,","death, hope, life, religion, sadness",0

Obviously, she required physical restraints to minimize damage to other parishioners and a cleanup crew for the broken pews, discarded clothing,mangled jewelry, and loose items strewn about. Yes, it took an army of ushers to physically restrain her. She was twice as big as a man. No one smaller than Shaquille O’Neal could take her down. Well, I became her parasite and First Responder. Whenever I saw aglare in her eyes, twitch in her neck, or frown on her face, I knew to move into position. But for me, getting injured was a badge of honor. I just had to be a part of her fiascos. Yet, on one Easter Sunday, I got more than I bargained for. When our youth choir created a stir, Sister Gertrude went haywire. First, she reverse dunked her grandbaby into my breadbasket. Once again, she knew I would be there for the airborne toddler. Second, a whole orchard of mixed fruits flew over my head. Third, a scarf, blouse, wig, and shoe were diverted my way. Finally, a bevy of oversized Ushers and Deacons twisted, pulled, and sacrificed themselves before Sister Gertrude went lax. It was the most outrageous display Zion Gate Union had ever seen.

Yet, seeing me wasn’t expected or desired. For sure, I was the last person on his list of surprises. Jerry adjusted his head and sharpened his bloodshot eyes. It wasthen his booze-bated breath greeted me well before he did. Ok, he was in a stupor or maybe on the rebound. Next, soiled diapers stole the little oxygen I had left—and I was still OUTDOORS.
Yet somehow, I mustered enough wind to greet my brother. I tried to beat him to the punch and said, “What’s up bruh?” What happened next stomped my soul me for years to come! He never bothered to truly acknowledge me. Yet, heresponded without hesitation, “You know I can’t have

any company!” Then he violently slammed the door shut! Jerry was gone! I couldn’t differentiate
from being stupid or dumbstruck. I just stood silent on his porch all alone for about five minutes. I’d dealt with Jerry’s nastiness many times before. But he would initially warm up before dropping his hammer. Without a doubt, l was lost, confused, and bewildered like a teen-age boy losing a prom date. Foolishly, I used logic to dissect my embarrassment.
First, the guy scolded me as if I should’ve known better! To be fair, Jerry was the breadwinner. His wife left him years ago. That part I understood. Only a fool would have hung around his crazy ass. It was amazing they got together, let alone stayed that way long enough to create those children. Yet, all his kids were pushing the ages of twenty andabove. What the hell did he mean, “I can’t receive any company!” Of course, I heard those crying babies which madehim a granddaddy. That was strangely obvious to his existence. Yes, the cycle continues!

Maybe because of the culture that we live in right now, we will no longer be able to have conversations across disagreement.

In cosy choice, the complacent lie,
Teasing open the serpent's eye,
To outflank, usurp then suppress,
A deceiver's mask under duress.

Delusion lays a gossamer snare,
Flicking forked tongues tasting air,
Devotion to clan, a dying dream,
Delirious mining of treachery's seam.

Battle drums as heroes rise,
Saving tribe and land by surprise,
The call to action, your country's plea,
The broad church of necessity.

Lessons echo in infancy's steps,
Territory gained, homeland re-annexed,
Skirmishes coalesce in a patriot's war,
To campfire tales of visionary valour.

Grey aftertaste of dawn's biting light,
In emptied pockets, lint lesions blight,
A funeral march, with posture askew,
To a larder bare, options few.

A cup of tea's transient balm,
Rip open bills in the trembling calm,
Hope flickers in redemption's seam,
Vanishing as we scratch a fragile dream.

Wages held back, our pleas ignored,
To cloudy ivory towers, we implored,
Shadow people ground to a husk,
Tiny crumb specks in the dusk.

An overseer's laugh, a cruel facade,
The golden rule's sick charade,
Fingers sear in the dying flame,
The keening wind calls my name.

Reflections shatter, a distorted view,
Pipe dreams, strangled at birth, through,
The shaming shade exacts its cost,
Each pore clogged with penury's frost.

In darkest siege, a spark may ignite,
Defiant ember beacon's twilight,
Hope battered, but refuses to die,
Whispered lifeline to the coldest sky.

O this world’s resplendent beauty,
Halting breath of sheer mortal me,
Words in my throat pause freely,
My eyes overflow involuntarily.

Salted joy’s bittersweet reign.
Sculptors can your looks ne’er feign,
The greatest reward gifted to me,
Wrenched away in coldest larceny.

Death shall hold no fear, I say,
With your sweet face to light my way,
At precipice edge, a smitten retinue,
My beloved, restored, so we continue.

2029,"I rolled around and hit my face to wake myself up, but the pain proved that everything was real - because pain is another word for reality. The surfaces were hard, indeed. My eyes were wide open and lucid, but fear had deformed everything, it had driven me into the hallucination and delirium. I stood up, shook the industrial refuse from my clothes, and went back, my heart beating more strongly than it should have, to the door gaping open in the great building's wall. I knew full well that on the outside, the building was perfectly rectangular, that there was no way for the door to open into a room, and yet it led into a virtual depth, as inexplicable as the depth of a photograph, or the depths of perspective that create a third, and false, dimension in paintings on a wall. If you could go inside a trompe l'oeil mural, you wouldn't descend into its fraudulent depths, you would only get smaller as you moved along unseen lines of perspective. You wouldn't move through constantly changing spaces, with porphyry arches and columns and unintelligible Biblical images opening and closing behind you; rather, they would change their shapes constantly, rectangles would become parallelograms and trapezoids, the arcs of circles would change into hyperbolas, and circle into ellipses, becoming thinner and thinner as they tried to look deeper and farther away. I often thought that the world, along its three dimensions, is an equally deceiving trompe l'oeil for the infinitely more complex eye of our mind, with its two cerebral hemispheres taking in the world at slightly different angles, such that, by combining rational analysis and mystical sensibility, speech and song, happiness and depression, the abject and the sublime, it will make the amazing rosebud of the fourth dimension open before us, with its pearly petals, with its full depth, with its cubic surface, with its hypercubic volume. As though an embryo didn't grow in its mother's womb but arrived, from far away, and only the illusion of perspective made it seem to grow, like a wayfarer approaching along an empty road. A wayfarer who, after he passes through the iliac portal, continues his illusory rise, first an infant, then a child, then an adolescent, and in the end, when he is face-to-face with you and looks you in the eyes, he smiles at you like a friend from the other side of the mirror, having found you again, at last.","Mircea Cărtărescu,","fourth-dimension, hope, madness-and-sanity, perspective-on-life",0

God forbid I talk about hope, it's so cliché.
Not that it doesn't exist, but it has become just that.
In a world of ready-made things, any effort is banal.
It must be delivered in liquid form,
Bauman and his diabolical lack of concreteness,
Liquid hope?
No, a lack of concrete hope.
Does it sound too romantic?
Maybe it does, and also,
resonates.
Isn't resonating in souls the desire of every poet,
every writer,
every thinker?
Is it only possible to resonate with that which is empty,
empty of itself?
Could it be that poets are nothing more
than empty completions,
resonating with one another?
In fact, perhaps that’s what it is.","modernity, Weariness, Simulation, Fragmentation, Emptiness",hope,0

Heirloom ingot cast in festering dirt,
No scaldy-faced defecator's lies,
Can tarnish gold's immutable worth.

Besmirched, perpetual gleam to my eyes,
Ne'er base, but plundered from thy berth,
Another's private treasure, I cannot despise,
Until thy loan fadeth i' th' afterbirth.

With cloistered secrets to impart,
Our correspondence doth expand,
Let it encompass thy tiny heart,
For when it groweth to understand.

When from distant quays, emotion sails,
My words guide thee in storms and gales.

Hope means to not lose sight,
Hope means to cause illumination.

Hope lights the way when clouds convene,
Hope brings sight when smog sets in.
Hope is the bird that heralds the dawn,
Hope is the answer to all things disheartening.

Never let intellect trod on the sapling of hope,
When things get rough intellect is first to scarper.
The brain needs backbone to trudge through hardship,
Without hope, backbone is first to lose its caper.

and perseverance
and yet
for those of us with patchwork lives
(projects, earnings, caretaking, home-tending,
playing, friending, loving, celebrating,

persistence and perseverance
has to be allowed
in patches,
not what from the outside might be viewed as
'normal'
(for whatever worth normal has,
the top of that overused bell curve).

So let me clarify.
When I talk about persistence,
it isn't about persistence of equal measure every day.
It's about not giving up on whatever is important to you,
and, especially, not giving up on yourself.
Some chapters of your life may allow many facets of your being,
others just cannot
and the feeling of failure that can arouse
is of no value.

Sometimes all you can do is ask yourself:
What must I do this week? today? next hour?
to continue the process as healthily as possible?
to accomplish the most?
It may be deep immersion in one,
or it may be an odd mix.
And tomorrow may be different.

And an unexpected gift may come and change everything.
And a Mack truck may hit and change everything.

Our answers to those questions may not look similar
but what I hope is similar
is the acceptance
of what must be.

È piuttosto la certezza che fare determinate cose abbia un senso a prescindere dal modo in cui andranno a finire.

2281,"A recovery friend of mine once belonged to an AA group called “What’s Your Motivation?” She said she’d always ask herself that in situations where she had to say or do something she might regret, and she’d ask others as well. She asked me that once or twice. So, you start out by asking yourself that question when the situation arises, and a lot of time you realize there is no good motive behind the thing you want to do or say, so you don’t say it. You don’t do it. After a while, it becomes second nature.

Unfortunately, however, so many people out there are living their lives while untreated for their afflictions. Whether it’s addiction, including alcoholism, or a type of personality disorder, their behavior often stems from how they feel about themselves based on other people’s words and actions, things they had inadvertently taken on and clung to fiercely. They may have a desperate need for attention, validation, admiration, and respect. Maybe their delusions distort their perception of themselves and how others view them. They are so busy worrying about themselves that they are often oblivious to their motives and may not realize how little regard they have for others. In a genuine sense, they are fighting for themselves, but they’re not winning.

Many of us have lived that way once upon a time and, because of it, spent a copious amount of energy on damage control. Knowing we said something we shouldn’t have said or did something we shouldn’t have done and going into this anxiety-ridden desperation to save our “image”—an image that likely isn’t real but a delusion. When we should be more concerned about apologizing or making amends, we’re more obsessed with not wanting to be seen in a negative light and having to act in order to change the negative perception.

It takes recovery, healing, and time to learn that if you are intent on doing the right thing, doing right by people, and having everyone’s best interests at heart, you’ll know how to react and respond to things. And if you ever say or do something you regret, you simply say you were wrong and apologize.

Empathy for others and for ourselves is what makes it possible. It makes us care about how we treat people and the effect it’s having on not only them but on our lives and the lives of anyone who cares about us. We eventually understand that how we treat people is just as important as catering to our own needs.

I think it’s important to understand what made us a certain way in life and to acknowledge that, but then we have to fix it. It becomes our job and responsibility to heal that so that we grow and change.

When dark forces mask your eyes
Happiness, a distant beacon dream
Hope approaches your warming fire
Enjoy a toast, before flavours teem

Each pillar of truth, now a traitor to you
Motherland cut in mercenary march
Bonfires of blood in purification rage
Cuckoos in the nest, gloat in the larch

Rebel droplets, merge into roaring flood
Abort the tyrant's myriad bastard heirs
Expel the puppets to the unyielding sea
Birthplace restored as the patriot dares

After the hours that Sarajevans pass
queuing with empty canisters of gas
to get the refills they wheel home in prams,
or queuing for the precious meagre grams
of bread they’re rationed to each day,
and often dodging snipers on the way,
or struggling up sometimes eleven flights
of stairs with water, then you’d think the nights of Sarajevo would be totally devoid
of people walking streets Serb shells destroyed,
but tonight in Sarajevo that’s just not the case

The young go walking at stroller’s pace,
black shapes impossible to mark
as Muslim, Serb or Croat in such dark,
in unlit streets you can’t distinguish who
calls bread hjleb or hleb or calls it kruh.

All take the evening air with stroller’s stride
no torches guide them, but they don’t collide except as one of the flirtatious ploys
when a girl’s dark shape is fancied by a boy’s.
Then the tender radar of the tone of voice shows by its signals she approves his choice.

Then match or lighter to a cigarette
to check in her eyes if he’s made progress yet.
And I see a pair who’ve certainly progressed beyond the tone of voice and match-flare test and he’s about, I think, to take her hand
and lead her away from where they stand
on two shell scars, where, in ‘92
Serb mortars massacred the breadshop queue
and blood-dunked crusts of shredded bread
lay on this pavement with the broken dead.

And at their feet in holes made by the mortar
that caused the massacre, now full of water
from the rain that’s poured down half the day,
though now even the smallest clouds have cleared away
leaving the Sarajevo star-filled evening sky
ideally bright and clear for bomber’s eye
in those two rain-full shell-holes the boy sees fragments of the splintered Pleiades,
sprinkled on those death-deep, death-dark wells splashed on the pavement by Serb mortar shells.

The dark boy-shape leads dark girl-shape away to share one coffee in a candlelit café
until the curfew, and he holds her hand

2472,"Trail of lovers

He had walked that path before,
It was a place that was like a sea with no shore,

But he walked anyway,
Relentlessly every night and everyday,

The path seemed to have no end,
But he had his hopes and his aspirations to defend,

He walked everyday, anyway,
And it was so even today,

The path appeared to extend into infinity,
And he hoped for a moment of serendipity,

But there was none, none at all,
The path continued always ahead of his will, and the person in him, unwilling to fall,

Until one day infinity got tired and abruptly ended,
For it had exhausted its every reserve of finite moments that to safeguard its pride it had expended,

When we all expected that he would now stop here,
He pronounced, “I seek something that lies everywhere!”

So, he continued walking and the path stretched as far as it could,
Then one day time too got tired and said, “Stop please. Stop. You should!”

But he smiled and walked anyway,
Because he knew the path he had taken was not to be determined by the trail of the way,

It lay in the vision of the mind where he bore her every sweet memory,
And they fed his quest that would place him on the trail that was starry,

Where sky was the limit, where time was the end, where everywhere was the direction,
Because that is what is felt by a heart kissed by love and someone’s true affection,

And the path has led him somewhere, that is what they say,
Where, I cannot say that, I cannot; nay!

Because time got tired chasing him and his trails of love,
Now they say he resides somewhere where you can reach only with the feelings of that special love,

That he felt, someday and someway,
And in its lure he traveled far, and finally too far away,

Where time gets tired to tread,
Because there only they go who on feelings of romantic love are fed!

And we often think of him, we even think of her, who made him so,
But there, we who can never travel ahead of time, dare not go,

There they now live together,
On the trail of time that lasts forever!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-quotes, love, love-quotes, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

It was not often she felt so,
It was not often he felt her so,

There was something about it and she wondered why was it so,
There was something within her asking her to let it be so,

It was beautiful, it was surreal, and nothing had ever made her feel so,
It was forever that she wished, if she could feel so,

And then wondered how could it be so,
Forever with him, forever around him; and then forever feel so,

Like the summer flower kissed my summer kisses, so often and so,
Like the summer flower, she wanted to feel and then be so,

And ah this feeling, to then forever feel so,
And ah the touch of the summer that makes the summer flower feel so,

A summer that it has never felt before, and it loves to feel so,
A summer that always returns just for her and makes her feel the flower within her, and ah the feeling thereof and so,

That is how my love Irma I feel, and the feeling is truly so,
That of the summer, the summer flower, and in it all, just you, and ah the wonder to feel so!

2519,"The lovers

They had loved, they had cried, and they had smiled, together;
Now they looked at the horizon of life and wished to gather,

The moments inextricably tied to their lives,
Upon which their present thrives,

But they think of the future, and the moments of love in it,
For they do not wish to live in the future, but a future with love in it,

A feeling that rises from the bottom of their hearts,
And then whether they are in the present or the future, it never departs,

With these inalienable feelings of love they wish to be,
For a day is lifeless when in each others eyes, their own reflections they cannot see,

The boy loves the woman in her, while the girl loves the man in him,
And this feeling lights up their pathways of life in moments where the light of hope is dim,

So, he touches her face and kisses her wherever he could,
And the girl feels everything a woman in her should,

Then they endlessly look at the horizon of life and watch it turn beautiful,
Because now he feels her and she feels him in ways fulfilling and full,

And as the evening spreads across their amorous universe,
Their feelings of love across it freely traverse,

She tells him her story of her heart beats, and the boy too repeats,
That how for her his heart everyday beats,

Loving her, feeling her, being with her, until he feels his universe exists only because of her,
And then once again he embraces her and then tenderly kisses her,

And they both disappear from the worldly sight,
Because they have evolved into everything now, the brightness of the day, and the beautiful secrets of the night,

So whenever you see two lovers looking at the horizon of their lives,
Be certain, that it is in them too, in their hopes, in their desires, that their love thrives,

Maybe they have disappeared, and there is no trace of theirs left for the eyes that only see,
Because the most beautiful virtues are the ones you can only feel and not see, with the eyes that feel before they see,

So, they have disappeared because they felt what no lover has ever felt,
And it was then I saw that even the horizon of the universe in their obeisance knelt,

And now they live in each other,
In the eyes of the other and forever together!

And I hear the universe say, “this is true love of true lovers!”
Who now love each other in the night's secrets, and their twinkling covers!

As I leave the scene Irma, the night covers me too,
And I escape into the world that it creates exclusively for me and for you!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-love-quotes, inspiring-quotes, love-quotes, love-quotes-and-sayings, poems-about-love, quotations-on-love, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

She ran her fingers through her hair,
A smile appeared, and faded in her face somewhere,
Then as she lifted her eyebrows and she removed her freely falling hair,
In her eyes I found my desires and their brilliant glows, and in them I too existed somewhere,
Their charm immediately sieged me from everywhere,
And I began sinking into her sensation, her dreams and her eyes, and in it I sank somewhere,

Where my desires flowed unto her,
Now even my closed eyes only beheld her,
Her beauty had cast me in the crucible of love and its endless affair,
That exuded feelings invading my soul, and I fell in love with her,
With the glow in her eyes, with the smile that gradually submerges into her,
And makes me feel that I am endlessly being kissed by her,

I was engulfed by a veritable need to be with her forever,
To be her only thought about a true, and her only lover,
Whom she romances in the daylight and in the night’s dark cover,
A beautiful feeling from which she can part never,
A crescendo of joy that with every passing moment turns lovelier,
Creating a cohesion of two feelings which coexist in the cocoon of love forever,

She with me and I with her,
Where all desires before these two feelings surrender,
Creating a universe of love where my heart beats no longer whisper,
But beat loud and confess that they only beat for her,
And in return she too confesses, “I too will love you forever!”
And I cannot help falling in love everytime I see the smile gracefully covering her.","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-quotes, love, love-quotes, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

What if time develops a trait to forget,
What if light does not travel at all,
What if life turns into a ceaseless moment of regret,
And every perception of height begins to crumble and fall,

What will become of the memories then,
What will become of the darkness,
Shall we be restricted to lead a life in a den,
Where there is everything packed within feelings riddled with moments of nothingness,

What will become of the love you felt,
What will become of the faces you come across everyday,
Shall the feeling die suddenly that arose in your heart when you had met,
That special someone on that very special moment, on that wonderful someday,


Will days then be reduced to just a someday, just another day,
Will feelings flow like a river that does not know its course,
But overflows its banks because it just wants to flow anyway,
Will you be then frozen in moments of endless remorse,

Because time has forgotten its preceding moments,
Memories exist but for what the mind is unable to discern,
And you lead a life that thrives on strange supplements,
Of needless worries, and exceedingly needless concern,

What if time stole from her my all memories,
What will then remind her of me,
Will she then lead a life of endless comedies or never ending tragedies,
Because in the crowd when I pass by she fails to recognise me,

I wonder what it will be like when time becomes forgetful,
And light cannot travel anymore,
Maybe I would choose to live in sublime moments deeply thoughtful,
Where I will only think of you and nothing else no more,

Then I will let time forget everything,
And let light not travel at all,
It cannot steal from me your memories because except you and your memories there is nothing,
And then both time and light shall in the abyss of your memories fall,

Where both will now only recognise you and bear your signatures,

2533,"As I loved

It was a moment of inner strife,
Where everything clashed with every force of life,

The feelings shielded the heart,
The memories protected the mind with an inimitable art,

And in this brutal battle I was caught,
Everything appeared flawed and with follies fraught,

Heart was beating to please the feelings,
And the mind dwelled on memories in its secret dealings,

But whatever their acts might have been,
They both were desperately trying to keep alive her beauty that they had once felt and seen,

And I let them indulge in their acts,
Because my heart through the memories of the mind was actually safeguarding its love pacts,

Made many decades ago,
But their authenticity and their freshness it could not forgo,

And I knew both of them were willingly caught in this situation,
Because it was their only possible means to offer me some emotional restoration,

So that they could live as I lived,
So that they felt loved as I loved!

And they both silently quoth, “we love her,”
And I openly said, “I love you because you love her!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-quotes, life, life-poems, life-quotes, love, love-quotes, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

2541,"Beauty and stone

In the huge town square,
A statue carved from stone witnessed every passer by,
And wondered how it could similar movements acquire,
So that it too could walk if not fly,

Its eyes constantly looked at the strange faces,
Its posture was always the same,
It stood at just one place and it could never visit other places,
For it had sacrificed everything in the static beauty’s name,

That is still, motionless, feelingless and always the same,
It even perceives different things with single perception of mind,
Cursed to play over and over again the same game,
Because for the statue-like beauty everything is predefined,

The posture, the view, the stance, and I guess even its every thought,
At least that is how I feel when I look at the statue placed in the main town square,
It seems to seek what it since eternity has sought,
Because it may bear a fixed expression, but that has nothing to do with its desire,

Because it expresses what its sculptor felt,
And in this crowded town square it looks the same every night, everyday and every time,
Of its own sweet will it has never with anything dealt,
It has witnessed many lovers’ kisses, and it has been witness to many a crime,

But it is its irony to be a statue and nothing else,
Beautiful to look at and admire,
But it has a missing pulse,
That of real, warm, sensitive and sensate beauty in its prime,

So, I sometimes look at it and just pretend it noticed me,
As I leave the spot, I see it unmoved and feelingless,
To it nothing matters, who you are or who you wish to be,
Because it is just beauty carved from stone, completely lifeless,

And then my love I think of you, and I miss you,
So I leave the statue and its stone carved beauty behind,
Because the statue is beautiful, but it cannot be you,
Therefore, instead in my memories and in my heart beats you I discover and always manage to find!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-love-quotes, inspiring-quotes, love, love-quotes, poems-about-love, quotations-on-love, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

Of new life at its term.

Like a dry flower petal that flies in the air,
Feeling it belongs to the sky,
I find her memories floating in my mind everywhere,
Whether I am thinking of her or in a vacant state of my mind I lie,

The memory, her memory, drifts from one neuron to another,
Until it settles where all her memories lie piled up,
And then these fragments and bits of memories condole each other,
And they all say together, “Hey you amorous soul, never give up!”

And all these memories rise and spread across my mind,
Hitched to every thought that arises from my cerebral thinking,
Though they think of now and sometimes of the future, eventually with her imaginations they all bind,
And in this pool of memories, now, time appears to be sinking,

So it doesn't matter whether it was yesterday or it is today,
Because I have been granted my wish,
That to lie immersed in her thoughts everyday,
In this pool of her memories the only fish,

That swims across it,
Feeds on it, and lives in this pool,
And then begins the true wonder of it,
The wonder of the romantic pool,

Where she assumes the form of every drop of memory,
And like a fish I swim and dive into her soul freely,
In a love’s own nursery,
Where I love her and romance her freely!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-quotes, love, love-quotes, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

He appeared to be moving in a definite direction,
Without any doubts or dereliction,
As I was ascending the escalator,
He was descending the stairs one at a time , like a helpless procrastinator,
And there I caught a glimpse of human emotion,
A feeling of surging and pristinely humane sensation,
A man who must have been in his mid sixties and ascending the escalator beside me,
With side parted grey hair and a composed look that even skies longed to see,
Caught the sight of the limp holding his bag in his left hand,
While he held his right leg with his right hand and pushed it to the next step, to maintain balance and anyhow stand,
He descended the stairs with caution, one step at a time,
And the left leg, was in complete denial to rhyme,
With the floundering right foot supported by his ankle high shoes,
But there was nothing to cover or hide his face bearing the painful blues,
The man looked at him and turned to see him again and again,
Then without making it obvious, he removed his spectacles and cleared his tears, as he revived his look simple and plain,
But it seemed he missed a heart beat when he saw the man limping in the crowd,
A rush of emotion crossed him and surged his existence and for anyone equally sensitive, it was silent yet very loud,
His feelings of sympathy were displayed all over his face,
The sadness that he managed to hide with a synthetic grace,
Failed in preventing him to constantly turn his head and look at the limping man,
Perhaps it reminded him of someone dear or he felt a fellow human beings pain culminating in the form of the limping man,
And he quietly wept and maybe felt deeply sorry for the limp and his relentless dragging,
For whatever reason the limp too turned and looked back, and both were locked in a momentary emotional tugging,
Where the limp gently smiled and bowed a bit,
The man tried to smile too but he couldn't, so he lifted his hand slowly and waved it at him, as if to tell him, keep walking, never stop or sit,
And then both pursued, rather were lured by their destinies,
One ascending, the other one descending, with their own dreams, own hopes and a bunch of certainties,
The man must be where he ought to be, the limp too might be at his destination now,
But today both of them conquered their destinies with that humbling and simple bow!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","encouragement-quotes, encouraging-quotes, hope, hope-quotes, hopeful-and-encouraging, inspirational, inspirational-quotes, life-quotes",0

They lifted off, the ground falling away behind them and she leaned against Fili, mentally picturing the final shards of the shell she'd built around herself falling away below her.

She was neither the naïve girl she'd been before her mother's death or the well of never-ending hate she'd been after.

She was Bilba, the daughter of Belladonna Took and Dwalin, son of Fundin.

She was Orcrist, Orc Cleaver, protector of the weak and defenseless.

She was the rider of Syrath, the partner and One of Fili, son of Vili, Crown Prince of Erebor.

She was her father's daughter and her mother's light.

She was more than what the orcs had tried to make her, more than what she'd made herself and more than the false foundations upon which she'd built her life.

She would rebuild again and, this time, it wouldn't be on the false hope of a fictional father she'd created in her mind and it wouldn't be on the twisted lie given to her by hate.

It would be based on truth, on what Fili and Syrath saw in her, what she was just starting to see in herself and what she saw when she looked at her father.

It would be based on allowing people in, not shutting them out.

Who’s laughing, she thinks furiously, only to realize that the sound was the sniffling of other people already weeping. At the realization, she is hard-put to suppress giggles instead. She thinks: maybe all ritual has mystery and absurdity, and maybe that is what it is for. It is a curious and complex thought and like most of her legacy from the madwoman it makes her head hurt. She concentrates then on her signing.","Candas Jane Dorsey,","deaf, grief, hope, language, loss, love, mystery, secret, slavery",0

National PTSD Awareness Month

Suicide is as an axe to a tree,
a commitment to a delusional freedom,
that you have not yet learned to be freed,
when indeed you can set yourself free
by doing little or as much as needed
to care for you in the state of hopelessness,
and when you are one of the seeds
prematurely fell from the tree
that you need to find your ground
to grow among the forest.

Living is a passage to an endless potential of tomorrow
that your worth is not bounded by the society’s narrow values,
but you strike with the principles that preserve your worthiness
to find your pathway to meet the ultimate goal of happiness.

2791,"Lifting from Depression


In the state of depression
feeling miserable, a statement undermining
all the potential harms when
self-worth knocking no mercy found,
hopelessness shadowing the self-worth
finding the false identity, absence from feeling
the way to feel.
Once depression sinking to the deepest state
of oppressing state, risking life
to mark the fault answer to end everything.


The depressed mood clouding the thinking mind,
impairing the judgement looking at life,
depressed mood, a desperate cry in mental despair,
when the reality of life is much brighter
than the state of depressing mood.
The reality of life is a hopeful life.


False sense of hopelessness,
a correctable state of the mind when do you
realized this? Disconfirming the strong false belief
of hopelessness is a way to go.
Depressed state of the mind can be lifted
with psychiatric care and psychotherapeutic help.
An early call to psychiatrist is the way to help,
and the loved ones offer emotional support
a good way to help, receiving help
the answer to redefining the state of the mind.


When adequate help arrives lifting from depression,
the depressed dark cloud lifted
from the state of depressed mind and you can clearly
see and move forward with what is in front of you.
Life backs into the living force,
keep on moving at will, living a full life
with life moving forward with all at will.

When one sees beyond knowing there is no beginning and no end, only an undeniable presence of something greater than self.

We understand the greater self is God.

Sometimes, I feel, God presents us with sorrow to show us there is hope for tomorrow.

When you touch another soul all souls unite and live as one spirit alive in the universe.

God blesses us in unseen ways daily. The time we share is our history.

Your endearing journey touches lives needing the love only you can give.

It was the time it took to heal a heart that had been shattered by loss. It was eternal, it seemed, until suddenly it was not.","Amanda Denney,","healing, hope, inspirational, recovery, sad",1

2913,"His hand touches my back lightly, making me shiver. 'Do you know what I admire about you?'

Truly, I cannot imagine what he will say next.

'That you never stopped being angry,' he tells me. 'It can be brave to hate. Sometimes it's like hope.'

I hadn't felt brave in the Court of Teeth. I had felt only a clawing desperation, as though I was forever drowning in some vast sea, gulping seawater as I sank, and then just when I felt I was going to let myself drop beneath the waves, something would make me kick one more time. Maybe that thing was hate. Hating requires going on, even when you can no longer believe in any better future.

2918,"My dear children, perhaps you won’t understand what I am saying to you, because I often speak very unintelligibly, but you’ll remember it all the same and will agree with my words some time. You must know that there is nothing higher and stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the future than some good memory, especially a memory of childhood, of home. People talk to you a great deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preserved from childhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man carries many such memories with him into life, he is safe to the end of his days, and if one has only one good memory left in one’s heart, even that may sometime be the means of saving us.","Fyodor Dostoyevsky,","happiness, hope, joy, youth",0

I enjoyed Finn’s conversational tour of Lòn Haven, and occasionally his death metal tapes. Here, on Lòn Haven, I was untethered from the past. Everything I’d carried for the last fifteen years – the shock of my pregnancy with Saffy, the grief at losing Sean, and now, that terrifying phone call – was gobbled up by the ravenous tide. And witnessing the Longing transform, stroke by stroke, into something a little less knackered, its former glory beginning to creep back, was rewarding.
