"One spiritual writer has observed that human beings are born with two diseases: life, from which we die; and hope, which says the first disease is not terminal. Hope is built into the structure of our personalities, into the depths of our unconscious; it plagues us to the very moment of our death.

"Though I myself am an atheist, I openly profess religion in the sense just mentioned, that is, a nature religion. I hate the idealism that wrenches man out of nature; I am not ashamed of my dependency on nature; I openly confess that the workings of nature affect not only my surface, my skin, my body, but also my core, my innermost being, that the air I breathe in bright weather has a salutary effect not only on my lungs but also on my mind, that the light of the sun illumines not only my eyes but also my spirit and my heart. And I do not, like a Christian, believe that such dependency is contrary to my true being or hope to be delivered from it. I know further that I am a finite moral being, that I shall one day cease to be.

The soldiers are being told that reinforcements are on the way, and that thought alone gives them the hope and courage to continue fighting, even if ultimately the reinforcements never arrive.

"Sometimes I think Earth has got to be the insane asylum of the universe. . . and I'm here by computer error. At sixty-eight, I hope I've gained some wisdom in the past fourteen lustrums and it’s obligatory to speak plain and true about the conclusions I've come to; now that I have been educated to believe by such mentors as Wells, Stapledon, Heinlein, van Vogt, Clarke, Pohl, (S. Fowler) Wright, Orwell, Taine, Temple, Gernsback, Campbell and other seminal influences in scientifiction, I regret the lack of any female writers but only Radclyffe Hall opened my eyes outside sci-fi.

I was a secular humanist before I knew the term. I have not believed in God since childhood's end. I believe a belief in any deity is adolescent, shameful and dangerous. How would you feel, surrounded by billions of human beings taking Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the tooth fairy and the stork seriously, and capable of shaming, maiming or murdering in their name? I am embarrassed to live in a world retaining any faith in church, prayer or a celestial creator. I do not believe in Heaven, Hell or a Hereafter; in angels, demons, ghosts, goblins, the Devil, vampires, ghouls, zombies, witches, warlocks, UFOs or other delusions; and in very few mundane individuals--politicians, lawyers, judges, priests, militarists, censors and just plain people. I respect the individual's right to abortion, suicide and euthanasia. I support birth control. I wish to Good that society were rid of smoking, drinking and drugs.

My hope for humanity - and I think sensible science fiction has a beneficial influence in this direction - is that one day everyone born will be whole in body and brain, will live a long life free from physical and emotional pain, will participate in a fulfilling way in their contribution to existence, will enjoy true love and friendship, will pity us 20th century barbarians who lived and died in an atrocious, anachronistic atmosphere of arson, rape, robbery, kidnapping, child abuse, insanity, murder, terrorism, war, smog, pollution, starvation and the other negative “norms” of our current civilization. I have devoted my life to amassing over a quarter million pieces of sf and fantasy as a present to posterity and I hope to be remembered as an altruist who would have been an accepted citizen of Utopia.",Forrest J.

"I understood that the most terrible thing in life is complete hopelessness... To cross out all the 'maybes' and give up the fight when you still have strength for it is the most terrible form of suicide. It's almost unbearable to watch it happening in others.

He took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his heart.

I think that on a certain day amongst those days which never dawned, and will not set, an angel entered Hades — stood, shone, smiled, delivered a prophecy of conditional pardon, kindled a doubtful hope of bliss to come, not now, but at a day and hour unlooked for, revealed in his own glory and grandeur the height and compass of his promise: spoke thus — then towering, became a star, and vanished into his own Heaven.

"Now I want you to remember something because I don't think we shall meet again very soon. It is this; however fashionable despair about the world and about people may be at present, and however powerful despair may become in the future, not everybody, or even most people, think and live fashionably; virtue and honour will not be banished from the world, however many popular moralists and panicky journalists say so. Sacrifice will not cease to be because psychiatrists have popularized the idea that there is often some concealed, self-serving element in it; theologians always knew that. Nor do I think love as a high condition of honour will be lost; it is a pattern in the spirit, and people long to make the pattern a reality in their own lives, whatever means they take to do so. In short, Davey, God is not dead. And I can assure you God is not mocked.","Robertson Davies,","despair, honour, hope, morality, virtue",8

the way my mother was lost in it for a while
as if with a kind of relief that doesn’t relieve.
And then, with her eyes closed, my mother said
the one or two words the living have for gratefulness,
which is a kind of forgetting, with a sense
of what it means to be alive long enough
to love someone. Thank you, she said. As for me,

"The reason why I am hopeful is because what we're now seeing is the formation of a new narrative struggle. When you're enslaved, you have to focus on freedom. When you're being terrorized and lynched, you have to focus on security. When you're disenfranchised and you don't have any opportunities for education and other businesses, you have to focus on civil rights. Now we're at a moment where we are in the beginnings of a narrative struggle. The reason why I'm hopeful is that earlier, even in my career, we didn't have thousands of committed journalists and professionals and storytellers and filmmakers and writers who could participate in this narrative structure.

"We have a collection of 800 jars of soil in our museum. We collect these soils from lynching sites. People who are involved in erecting markers collect the soil, put it in a jar that has the name of the victim, the date of the victim, and then they bring it back to the museum.

An older Black woman was digging soil at a site in west Alabama. She was afraid because it was on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. As she was about to dig, a big white man in a pickup truck drove by and stared at her. It made her anxious. Then he drove by again and stared some more. Then he parked his truck, got out, and walked toward her. She was terrified. Then the man asked, ""What are you doing?"" She was going to tell him that she was just getting dirt for her garden. Then she said, ""Mr. Stevenson, something got ahold of me. I told that man, I'm digging soil here because this is where a Black man was lynched in 1937."" She just looked down and started digging.

The man surprised her by asking, ""Does that memo you have talk about the lynching?"" She said, ""It does."" Then he asked, ""Can I read it?"" He started reading while she started digging. After he finished reading the memo, he said, ""Would it be all right if I helped you?"" She said, ""Yes."" The man got down on his knees, and she offered him the implement to dig the soil. He said, ""No, no, no, no, no, you keep that. I'll just use my hands."" She said he started picking up the soil and putting it in the jar, and throwing his hand into the soil. She said there was something about the conviction with which he was putting his whole body into this that moved her.

She went from fear to relief to joy so quickly she couldn't help it. Tears were running down her face. The man turned to her and he said, ""Oh, ma'am, I'm so sorry I'm upsetting you."" She said, ""No, no, no. You're blessing me."" They kept digging, and they were getting near to filling the jar. She looked over at the man, and she noticed that he had slowed down. His face had turned red. Then she saw that there was a tear running down his face. She reached over and put her hand on his shoulder. She said, ""Are you all right?"" That's when the man turned her, and he said, ""No, ma'am."" He said, ""I'm just so worried that it might have been my grandfather who helped lynch this man.""

She said they both sat on that roadside and wept. She said, I'm going to go back and put this jar of soil in the museum in Montgomery. Then the man said, ""Ma'am, would it be all right if I just followed you back?"" She said, ""Sure."" She called me on the way back. She said, ""Mr. Stevenson, I want you to come to the museum and meet my new friend."" I was there when these two people who met on a roadside in a place of pain and agony and violence and bigotry came in and together did something beautiful by putting that jar of soil in that exhibit.

I'm not naive. I don't believe that beautiful things like that always happen when we tell the truth. I do believe that we deny ourselves the beauty of justice when we refuse to tell the truth. I've seen too much beauty come out of truth-telling, too much restoration, too much redemption, to believe that truth-telling doesn't have a power that is greater than the fear and anger that is prompting these orders, prompting some of this retreat. I worry about people who are already surrendering and waving white flags, and running for cover.

And it shatters them completely, into one million pieces, and it seems like there is no coming back. It’s over. But in time they put themselves together piece by piece. And the thing is, when they do that, they often find that they are a different person, a changed, more complete, more realized, more clearly drawn person.

"Beachcomber by Stewart Stafford

Sundial straight, I strode onshore,
Waves pulsing like a foetal lullaby,
Canine companion nestling my knee,
A chef's kiss-of-life breathing space.

Looking glass shimmer at the cliff's base,
Tranquility’s wellspring beneath my feet,
Sanctum of meditation, a paused life retreat,
My seagull eyewitnesses hovering above.

The seclusion sought yielded rewards,
A hit of joie de vivre in its purest form,
The sky’s spotlight and the humid wind,
Senses alive with the lapping, busy tide.

Nascent cloud veils gather at magic hour,
Amber inferno, foretaste of paradise,
Welcomed, savoured, and appreciated,
Driftwood floating home on sunset waters.

Perhaps, one day, we’ll cross each other’s path,
Not by design, but some strange twist of fate.
You’ll glance, and I will feel the world go still.
Your eyes will find mine—soft, unreadable—
And in that gaze, my chest will tighten fast,
A fluttered breath I cannot hold inside.

I’ll wonder then, do you still see through me?
That way you did, as if my soul were glass,
No secrets veiled, no walls I’d ever built—
As though my silence whispered all to you.
I’ll stand there, caught between what was and is,
A moment wrapped in quiet, aching heat.

Old feelings, like a tide, will rise again,
Beyond the grasp of reason or of will.
I will not move, nor will I turn away,
And yet, I will not speak. I’ll let it pass.

But I won’t cry—not there, not in your sight.
The tears, if any come, will wait till dusk,
Or till the echo fades within my chest.

Fen looks surprised by this.

“What that instability does to relationships—what constant danger does to them—is devastating. It’s unraveling.”

"And for the first time, I distance myself from the personal tragedy that has consumed me since they announced the Quell. I remember the old man they shot in District 11, and Bonnie and Twill, and the rumoured uprisings. Yes, everyone in the districts will be watching me to see how I handle this death sentence, this final act of President Snow's dominance. They will be looking for some sign that their battles have not been in vain. If I can make it clear that I'm still defying the Capitol right up to the end, the Capitol will have killed me...but not my spirit. What better way to give hope to the rebels?

The beauty of this idea is that my decision to keep Peeta alive at the expense of my own life is itself an act of defiance. A refusal to play the Hunger Games by the Capitol's rules. My private agenda dovetails completely with my public one. And if I really could save Peeta... in terms of a revolution, this would be ideal. Because I will be more valuable dead. They can turn me into some kind of martyr for the cause and paint my face on banners, and it will do more to rally people than anything I could do if I was living. But Peeta would be more valuable alive, and tragic, because he will be able to turn his pain into words that will transform people.","Suzanne Collins,","defiance, hope, inspirational, katniss-everdeen, rebellion, revolution, tragic",0

"Wittgenstein wrote a comprehensive critique of the Scottish anthropologist J. G. Frazer's masterpiece ""The Golden Bough"" (1890), a comparative study of religion and mythology. One of Wittgenstein's main objections was that Frazer ascribes the natives he discusses with irrational beliefs for which there is no evidence: for example, that a certain ritual will make it rain. The problem is that Frazer is unable to see what the natives are actually doing. Wittgenstein states: ""Frazer is much more savage than most of his savages... His explanations of primitive practices are much cruder than the meaning of these practices themselves."" While Frazer believes that the natives' actions are based on mistaken beliefs about causal relationships, Wittgenstein suggests that they are not based on such beliefs at all.

Once, after a very bad game, I smashed my tennis racket. Had my opponent thought like Frazer, he would have believed that my action was a ritual sacrifice aimed at changing the outcome of the tournament for me. But my action was not based on any such expectation. It was simply an immature expression of anger and disappointment. The most reasonable understanding of the natives' ritual practices involves considering them as expressions of hope, among other things, not as irrational notions of causal relationships. Our idea of causation stems from us observing regularities. We will have repeatedly seen that A is followed by B. What regularities would have led the natives to see a causal relationship between a specific ritual and a specific natural phenomenon such as rain? Is is unlikely that rain was usually brought about by a specific dance, and the natives must have seen that it sometimes rains despite no ritual being performed. Not least, the natives should have danced a lot during the driest parts of the year, but they didn't. So it's far more plausible to consider this dance an expression of hoping for rain. From that perspective there is nothing irrational about the natives' actions. The dancing is a shared expression of their understanding that the desired rain might come.","Lars Svendsen,","anthropology, hope, philosophy, ritual",0

"You know the most beautiful part of Love?
You can Never Ever wish them harm no matter how much hurt they threw your way.
How can you, when You have prayed for them for days after days, when you have literally begged God for their well-being. No, you can ask the same God to let you forget them, but deep inside even in that prayer, you would send them Hope, you would send them Love.
You can Never allow yourself to hear anything negative, even minutely disgraceful about them, no matter how many insults they might have pulled your way. No, you can silently walk away, but you would never want to hear anything wrong being said about them, in fact you would stand first to leave the room when such a thing happen or maybe fight fiercely for them simply because your heart wouldn't allow it no matter how much your mind might argue otherwise.
And even when your Hurt runs deep, even when the wounds won't ever stop bleeding, even when you might never have received even a fraction of what you gave, you would still give in a way that is beyond any logic, you would give in the virtue of Grace and Dignity in knowing that Love can Never be turned in Hate, yes when you Love someone Immensely, it might sometimes turn into Hate, but when You Loved Someone with all the Hopes and Dreams of a Home, even when the Home breaks, you still hold on to the foundations with a Grace that Only God Understands.

"Faith, hope, and charity complement each other, and as one increases, the others grow as well. Hope comes of faith (see Ether 12:4), for without faith, there is no hope (see Moroni 7:42). In like manner, faith comes of hope, for faith is “the substance of things hoped for” (Hebrews 11:1).

Hope is critical to both faith and charity. When disobedience, disappointment, and procrastination erode faith, hope is there to uphold our faith. When frustration and impatience challenge charity, hope braces our resolve and urges us to care for our neighbors even without expectation of reward. The brighter our hope, the greater our faith. The stronger our hope, the purer our charity.

The things we hope for lead us to faith, while the things we hope in lead us to charity.",Dieter F. Uchtdorf,"charity, christianity, faith, god, hope",0

"Unspoken Sonata by Stewart Stafford

Love's lullaby's unheard duet,
Kisses of life drown shallow opinions,
Prejudged by logic, yet set apart,
Our oasis bars the negative legions.

Eternal tongues of a mother lode;
Looks of love, a second-sight ploy,
To visions beyond earthly interpretation;
Dance down darkest paths to ecstatic joy.

Spoiler seers nix romantic ideals;
Abyssal agendas in jealousy's biome,
A caterpillar doxxed for its butterfly shape,
Real love's navigator guides us home.

"A Mother Steeled by Stewart Stafford

A haunted mother in despair's glade,
That echoed with her feral screams,
Sifting through tiny bones for reasons,
Catharsis an absent but invited guest.

Healed knees, once bloody, kneel,
Cobwebs wiped, storm damage fixed,
Bittersweet, her baby has taken wing,
His bruises, all of him, now flown above.

Daybreak's star field on the final vigil,
Dropping the self-flagellation whip,
Fragment memories of her infant taken,
Striding forth, her scars a living map.

"There is a certain grief in things as they are, in man as he has come to be, as he certainly is, over and above those griefs of circumstance which are in a measure removable—some inexplicable shortcoming, or misadventure, on the part of nature itself—death, and old age as it must needs be, and that watching for their approach, which makes every stage of life like a dying over and over again. Almost all death is painful, and in every thing that comes to an end a touch of death, and therefore of wretched coldness struck home to one, of remorse, of loss and parting, of outraged attachments. Given faultless men and women, given a perfect state of society which should have no need to practise on men’s susceptibilities for its own selfish ends, adding one turn more to the wheel of the great rack for its own interest or amusement, there would still be this evil in the world, of a certain necessary sorrow and desolation, felt, just in proportion to the moral, or nervous perfection men have attained to. And what we need in the world, over against that, is a certain permanent and general power of compassion—humanity’s standing force of self-pity—as an elementary ingredient of our social atmosphere, if we are to live in it at all. I wonder, sometimes, in what way man has cajoled himself into the bearing of his burden thus far, seeing how every step in the capacity of apprehension his labour has won for him, from age to age, must needs increase his dejection. It is as if the increase of knowledge were but an increasing revelation of the radical hopelessness of his position: and I would that there were one even as I, behind this vain show of things!","Walter Pater,","death, hope, life, religion, sadness",0

"Once Pastor Keith hit a crescendo, Sister Gertrude would rise and jump, scream, kick, dance, and pass the hell out. Obviously, she required physical restraints to minimize damage to other parishioners and a cleanup crew for the broken pews, discarded clothing,mangled jewelry, and loose items strewn about. Yes, it took an army of ushers to physically restrain her. She was twice as big as a man. No one smaller than Shaquille O’Neal could take her down. Well, I became her parasite and First Responder. Whenever I saw aglare in her eyes, twitch in her neck, or frown on her face, I knew to move into position. But for me, getting injured was a badge of honor. I just had to be a part of her fiascos. Yet, on one Easter Sunday, I got more than I bargained for. When our youth choir created a stir, Sister Gertrude went haywire. First, she reverse dunked her grandbaby into my breadbasket. Once again, she knew I would be there for the airborne toddler. Second, a whole orchard of mixed fruits flew over my head. Third, a scarf, blouse, wig, and shoe were diverted my way. Finally, a bevy of oversized Ushers and Deacons twisted, pulled, and sacrificed themselves before Sister Gertrude went lax. It was the most outrageous display Zion Gate Union had ever seen.

"He opened the door wearing an oversized wife-beater and dirty trunks to match. Funny, but he recognized me withouta struggle. Immediately, I assumed he was sober, which was a good thing.

It wasthen his booze-bated breath greeted me well before he did. Ok, he was in a stupor or maybe on the rebound. Next, soiled diapers stole the little oxygen I had left—and I was still OUTDOORS.
Yet somehow, I mustered enough wind to greet my brother. I tried to beat him to the punch and said, “What’s up bruh?” What happened next stomped my soul me for years to come! He never bothered to truly acknowledge me. Yet, heresponded without hesitation, “You know I can’t have

any company!” Then he violently slammed the door shut! Jerry was gone! I couldn’t differentiate
from being stupid or dumbstruck. I just stood silent on his porch all alone for about five minutes. I’d dealt with Jerry’s nastiness many times before. But he would initially warm up before dropping his hammer. Without a doubt, l was lost, confused, and bewildered like a teen-age boy losing a prom date. Foolishly, I used logic to dissect my embarrassment.
First, the guy scolded me as if I should’ve known better! To be fair, Jerry was the breadwinner. His wife left him years ago. That part I understood. Only a fool would have hung around his crazy ass. It was amazing they got together, let alone stayed that way long enough to create those children. Yet, all his kids were pushing the ages of twenty andabove.

"Arise Reborn! by Stewart Stafford

In cosy choice, the complacent lie,
Teasing open the serpent's eye,
To outflank, usurp then suppress,
A deceiver's mask under duress.

Delusion lays a gossamer snare,
Flicking forked tongues tasting air,
Devotion to clan, a dying dream,
Delirious mining of treachery's seam.

Battle drums as heroes rise,
Saving tribe and land by surprise,
The call to action, your country's plea,
The broad church of necessity.

Lessons echo in infancy's steps,
Territory gained, homeland re-annexed,
Skirmishes coalesce in a patriot's war,
To campfire tales of visionary valour.

"Tomorrow We Starve by Stewart Stafford

Grey aftertaste of dawn's biting light,
In emptied pockets, lint lesions blight,
A funeral march, with posture askew,
To a larder bare, options few.

A cup of tea's transient balm,
Rip open bills in the trembling calm,
Hope flickers in redemption's seam,
Vanishing as we scratch a fragile dream.

Wages held back, our pleas ignored,
To cloudy ivory towers, we implored,
Shadow people ground to a husk,
Tiny crumb specks in the dusk.

An overseer's laugh, a cruel facade,
The golden rule's sick charade,
Fingers sear in the dying flame,
The keening wind calls my name.

Reflections shatter, a distorted view,
Pipe dreams, strangled at birth, through,
The shaming shade exacts its cost,
Each pore clogged with penury's frost.

In darkest siege, a spark may ignite,
Defiant ember beacon's twilight,
Hope battered, but refuses to die,
Whispered lifeline to the coldest sky.

O this world’s resplendent beauty,
Halting breath of sheer mortal me,
Words in my throat pause freely,
My eyes overflow involuntarily.

Salted joy’s bittersweet reign.
Sculptors can your looks ne’er feign,
The greatest reward gifted to me,
Wrenched away in coldest larceny.

Death shall hold no fear, I say,
With your sweet face to light my way,
At precipice edge, a smitten retinue,
My beloved, restored, so we continue.

"I rolled around and hit my face to wake myself up, but the pain proved that everything was real - because pain is another word for reality. The surfaces were hard, indeed. My eyes were wide open and lucid, but fear had deformed everything, it had driven me into the hallucination and delirium. I stood up, shook the industrial refuse from my clothes, and went back, my heart beating more strongly than it should have, to the door gaping open in the great building's wall. I knew full well that on the outside, the building was perfectly rectangular, that there was no way for the door to open into a room, and yet it led into a virtual depth, as inexplicable as the depth of a photograph, or the depths of perspective that create a third, and false, dimension in paintings on a wall. If you could go inside a trompe l'oeil mural, you wouldn't descend into its fraudulent depths, you would only get smaller as you moved along unseen lines of perspective. You wouldn't move through constantly changing spaces, with porphyry arches and columns and unintelligible Biblical images opening and closing behind you; rather, they would change their shapes constantly, rectangles would become parallelograms and trapezoids, the arcs of circles would change into hyperbolas, and circle into ellipses, becoming thinner and thinner as they tried to look deeper and farther away. I often thought that the world, along its three dimensions, is an equally deceiving trompe l'oeil for the infinitely more complex eye of our mind, with its two cerebral hemispheres taking in the world at slightly different angles, such that, by combining rational analysis and mystical sensibility, speech and song, happiness and depression, the abject and the sublime, it will make the amazing rosebud of the fourth dimension open before us, with its pearly petals, with its full depth, with its cubic surface, with its hypercubic volume. As though an embryo didn't grow in its mother's womb but arrived, from far away, and only the illusion of perspective made it seem to grow, like a wayfarer approaching along an empty road. A wayfarer who, after he passes through the iliac portal, continues his illusory rise, first an infant, then a child, then an adolescent, and in the end, when he is face-to-face with you and looks you in the eyes, he smiles at you like a friend from the other side of the mirror, having found you again, at last.","Mircea Cărtărescu,","fourth-dimension, hope, madness-and-sanity, perspective-on-life",0

God forbid I talk about hope, it's so cliché.
Not that it doesn't exist, but it has become just that.
In a world of ready-made things, any effort is banal.
It must be delivered in liquid form,
Bauman and his diabolical lack of concreteness,
Liquid hope?
No, a lack of concrete hope.
Does it sound too romantic?
Maybe it does, and also,
resonates.
Isn't resonating in souls the desire of every poet,
every writer,
every thinker?
Is it only possible to resonate with that which is empty,
empty of itself?
Could it be that poets are nothing more
than empty completions,
resonating with one another?
In fact, perhaps that’s what it is.","modernity, Weariness, Simulation, Fragmentation, Emptiness",hope,0

Heirloom ingot cast in festering dirt,
No scaldy-faced defecator's lies,
Can tarnish gold's immutable worth.

Besmirched, perpetual gleam to my eyes,
Ne'er base, but plundered from thy berth,
Another's private treasure, I cannot despise,
Until thy loan fadeth i' th' afterbirth.

With cloistered secrets to impart,
Our correspondence doth expand,
Let it encompass thy tiny heart,
For when it groweth to understand.

When from distant quays, emotion sails,
My words guide thee in storms and gales.

"What Hope Means (The Sonnet)

What do you think hope means,
To sit and do nothing!
Such is no hope but cowardice,
Real hope gets you walking.

Hope means to take charge,
Hope means unsubmission.
Hope means to not lose sight,
Hope means to cause illumination.

Life is what happens to the human,
Human is what happens to life.
Nature is what happens to the animal,
Human is the animal rising civilized.

Hope is nature's defibrillator that,
Electrifies the heart to unsubmission.

Hope drags the being even out of cremation.

Hope lights the way when clouds convene,
Hope brings sight when smog sets in.
Hope is the bird that heralds the dawn,
Hope is the answer to all things disheartening.

Never let intellect trod on the sapling of hope,
When things get rough intellect is first to scarper.
The brain needs backbone to trudge through hardship,
Without hope, backbone is first to lose its caper.

"Doubtless these desperate and dark struggles are to be called superstition when viewed by the side of true religion ; and it is easy enough to speak of them as superstition, when we have been informed of the gracious and joyful result in which the scheme of Divine Governance issues. But it is man’s truest and best religion, before the Gospel shines on him. If our race be in a fallen and depraved state, what ought our religion to be but anxiety and remorse till God comfort us? Surely to be in gloom— -to view ourselves with horror — to look about to the right hand and to the left for means of safety — to catch at everything, yet trust in nothing— to do all we can, and try to do more than all — and, after all, to wait in miserable suspense, naked and shivering, among the trees of the garden, for the hour of His coming, and meanwhile to fancy sounds of woe in every wind stirring the leaves about us — in a word, to be superstitious — is nature’s best offering, her most acceptable service, her most mature and enlarged wisdom, in the presence of a holy and offended God .","John Henry Newman,","fear, hope, love, rationalism, superstition",0

Brings aught on which the sadden'd heart can

Of light and joy, doth but the more oppress,
Claiming responsive smiles and rapture high;

"I've written about persistence
and perseverance
and yet
for those of us with patchwork lives
(projects, earnings, caretaking, home-tending,
playing, friending, loving, celebrating,
hurting, grieving, healing, assessing, re-grouping)
persistence and perseverance
has to be allowed
in patches,
not what from the outside might be viewed as
'normal'
(for whatever worth normal has,
the top of that overused bell curve).

So let me clarify.
When I talk about persistence,
it isn't about persistence of equal measure every day.
It's about not giving up on whatever is important to you,
and, especially, not giving up on yourself.
Some chapters of your life may allow many facets of your being,
others just cannot
and the feeling of failure that can arouse
is of no value.

Sometimes all you can do is ask yourself:
What must I do this week? today? next hour?
to continue the process as healthily as possible?
to accomplish the most?
It may be deep immersion in one,
or it may be an odd mix.
And tomorrow may be different.

And an unexpected gift may come and change everything.
And a Mack truck may hit and change everything.

Our answers to those questions may not look similar
but what I hope is similar
is the acceptance
of what must be.

È piuttosto la certezza che fare determinate cose abbia un senso a prescindere dal modo in cui andranno a finire. Dall'altra parte, la fede senza speranza è di certo meno ingenua del puro ottimismo, ma ha la faccia rinsecchita del tradizionalismo, si presenta cioè come una gravosa manutenzione di abitudini durate a lungo.","Michela Murgia,","faith, hope, optimism, optimistic",0

"A recovery friend of mine once belonged to an AA group called “What’s Your Motivation?” She said she’d always ask herself that in situations where she had to say or do something she might regret, and she’d ask others as well. She asked me that once or twice. So, you start out by asking yourself that question when the situation arises, and a lot of time you realize there is no good motive behind the thing you want to do or say, so you don’t say it. You don’t do it. After a while, it becomes second nature.

Unfortunately, however, so many people out there are living their lives while untreated for their afflictions. Whether it’s addiction, including alcoholism, or a type of personality disorder, their behavior often stems from how they feel about themselves based on other people’s words and actions, things they had inadvertently taken on and clung to fiercely. They may have a desperate need for attention, validation, admiration, and respect. Maybe their delusions distort their perception of themselves and how others view them. They are so busy worrying about themselves that they are often oblivious to their motives and may not realize how little regard they have for others. In a genuine sense, they are fighting for themselves, but they’re not winning.

Many of us have lived that way once upon a time and, because of it, spent a copious amount of energy on damage control. Knowing we said something we shouldn’t have said or did something we shouldn’t have done and going into this anxiety-ridden desperation to save our “image”—an image that likely isn’t real but a delusion. When we should be more concerned about apologizing or making amends, we’re more obsessed with not wanting to be seen in a negative light and having to act in order to change the negative perception.

It takes recovery, healing, and time to learn that if you are intent on doing the right thing, doing right by people, and having everyone’s best interests at heart, you’ll know how to react and respond to things. And if you ever say or do something you regret, you simply say you were wrong and apologize.

Empathy for others and for ourselves is what makes it possible. It makes us care about how we treat people and the effect it’s having on not only them but on our lives and the lives of anyone who cares about us. We eventually understand that how we treat people is just as important as catering to our own needs.

I think it’s important to understand what made us a certain way in life and to acknowledge that, but then we have to fix it. It becomes our job and responsibility to heal that so that we grow and change.

"Impostor Times by Stewart Stafford

When dark forces mask your eyes
Happiness, a distant beacon dream
Hope approaches your warming fire
Enjoy a toast, before flavours teem

Each pillar of truth, now a traitor to you
Motherland cut in mercenary march
Bonfires of blood in purification rage
Cuckoos in the nest, gloat in the larch

Rebel droplets, merge into roaring flood
Abort the tyrant's myriad bastard heirs
Expel the puppets to the unyielding sea
Birthplace restored as the patriot dares

"The Bright Lights of Sarajevo

After the hours that Sarajevans pass
queuing with empty canisters of gas
to get the refills they wheel home in prams,
or queuing for the precious meagre grams
of bread they’re rationed to each day,
and often dodging snipers on the way,
or struggling up sometimes eleven flights
of stairs with water, then you’d think the nights of Sarajevo would be totally devoid
of people walking streets Serb shells destroyed,
but tonight in Sarajevo that’s just not the case

The young go walking at stroller’s pace,
black shapes impossible to mark
as Muslim, Serb or Croat in such dark,
in unlit streets you can’t distinguish who
calls bread hjleb or hleb or calls it kruh.

All take the evening air with stroller’s stride
no torches guide them, but they don’t collide except as one of the flirtatious ploys
when a girl’s dark shape is fancied by a boy’s.
Then the tender radar of the tone of voice shows by its signals she approves his choice.

Then match or lighter to a cigarette
to check in her eyes if he’s made progress yet.
And I see a pair who’ve certainly progressed beyond the tone of voice and match-flare test and he’s about, I think, to take her hand
and lead her away from where they stand
on two shell scars, where, in ‘92
Serb mortars massacred the breadshop queue
and blood-dunked crusts of shredded bread
lay on this pavement with the broken dead.

And at their feet in holes made by the mortar
that caused the massacre, now full of water
from the rain that’s poured down half the day,
though now even the smallest clouds have cleared away
leaving the Sarajevo star-filled evening sky
ideally bright and clear for bomber’s eye
in those two rain-full shell-holes the boy sees fragments of the splintered Pleiades,
sprinkled on those death-deep, death-dark wells splashed on the pavement by Serb mortar shells.

The dark boy-shape leads dark girl-shape away to share one coffee in a candlelit café

War is cruel. It's cancerous. The end of the world is always tied to war, isn't it? Maybe this is why; because war is so much more than just war. It goes beyond bullets and blood and bodies. War comes in like a flood, like a disease, and it claims anyone who comes in contact with it. Even the living can't get free from it; they're as claimed as the dead are.

"How we heal the world'

Sometimes I sit in silence and watch the world, how it burns so slowly. The fumes almost stifling, but then I think of love. Of hearts that continue to show mercy. Of a gentle nod from a stranger, acknowledging and existence. Without knowing, it is a truth that love binds us. The compassion of the world has never been lost. Love is our salvation, the very basis upon which we exist. First as thought then manifested in flesh. How love fills the spaces between grief and breath.

"Trail of lovers

He had walked that path before,
It was a place that was like a sea with no shore,

But he walked anyway,
Relentlessly every night and everyday,

The path seemed to have no end,
But he had his hopes and his aspirations to defend,

He walked everyday, anyway,
And it was so even today,

The path appeared to extend into infinity,
And he hoped for a moment of serendipity,

But there was none, none at all,
The path continued always ahead of his will, and the person in him, unwilling to fall,

Until one day infinity got tired and abruptly ended,
For it had exhausted its every reserve of finite moments that to safeguard its pride it had expended,

When we all expected that he would now stop here,
He pronounced, “I seek something that lies everywhere!”

So, he continued walking and the path stretched as far as it could,
Then one day time too got tired and said, “Stop please. Stop. You should!”

But he smiled and walked anyway,
Because he knew the path he had taken was not to be determined by the trail of the way,

It lay in the vision of the mind where he bore her every sweet memory,
And they fed his quest that would place him on the trail that was starry,

Where sky was the limit, where time was the end, where everywhere was the direction,
Because that is what is felt by a heart kissed by love and someone’s true affection,

And the path has led him somewhere, that is what they say,
Where, I cannot say that, I cannot; nay!

Because time got tired chasing him and his trails of love,
Now they say he resides somewhere where you can reach only with the feelings of that special love,

That he felt, someday and someway,
And in its lure he traveled far, and finally too far away,

Where time gets tired to tread,
Because there only they go who on feelings of romantic love are fed!

And we often think of him, we even think of her, who made him so,
But there, we who can never travel ahead of time, dare not go,

There they now live together,
On the trail of time that lasts forever!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-quotes, love, love-quotes, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

"Feeling so

It was not often she felt so,
It was not often he felt her so,

There was something about it and she wondered why was it so,
There was something within her asking her to let it be so,

It was beautiful, it was surreal, and nothing had ever made her feel so,
It was forever that she wished, if she could feel so,

And then wondered how could it be so,
Forever with him, forever around him; and then forever feel so,

Like the summer flower kissed my summer kisses, so often and so,
Like the summer flower, she wanted to feel and then be so,

And ah this feeling, to then forever feel so,
And ah the touch of the summer that makes the summer flower feel so,

A summer that it has never felt before, and it loves to feel so,
A summer that always returns just for her and makes her feel the flower within her, and ah the feeling thereof and so,

That is how my love Irma I feel, and the feeling is truly so,
That of the summer, the summer flower, and in it all, just you, and ah the wonder to feel so!

We take what we've been told are the best bits of other people's lives and set them as the preconditions for our own satisfaction. We search for home by enforcing someone else's vision of what the word home means. Along the way, we overlook the quirky beauty within the wrinkles, the beauty has always belonged to us and only us. If we want to find our place in the world, we have to let our lives be particular, personal, idiosyncratic. We have to live like we're fearfully and wonderfully made, like we're God's wabi-sabi works of art.

"The lovers

They had loved, they had cried, and they had smiled, together;
Now they looked at the horizon of life and wished to gather,

The moments inextricably tied to their lives,
Upon which their present thrives,

But they think of the future, and the moments of love in it,
For they do not wish to live in the future, but a future with love in it,

A feeling that rises from the bottom of their hearts,
And then whether they are in the present or the future, it never departs,

With these inalienable feelings of love they wish to be,
For a day is lifeless when in each others eyes, their own reflections they cannot see,

The boy loves the woman in her, while the girl loves the man in him,
And this feeling lights up their pathways of life in moments where the light of hope is dim,

So, he touches her face and kisses her wherever he could,
And the girl feels everything a woman in her should,

Then they endlessly look at the horizon of life and watch it turn beautiful,
Because now he feels her and she feels him in ways fulfilling and full,

And as the evening spreads across their amorous universe,
Their feelings of love across it freely traverse,

She tells him her story of her heart beats, and the boy too repeats,
That how for her his heart everyday beats,

Loving her, feeling her, being with her, until he feels his universe exists only because of her,
And then once again he embraces her and then tenderly kisses her,

And they both disappear from the worldly sight,
Because they have evolved into everything now, the brightness of the day, and the beautiful secrets of the night,

So whenever you see two lovers looking at the horizon of their lives,
Be certain, that it is in them too, in their hopes, in their desires, that their love thrives,

Maybe they have disappeared, and there is no trace of theirs left for the eyes that only see,
Because the most beautiful virtues are the ones you can only feel and not see, with the eyes that feel before they see,

So, they have disappeared because they felt what no lover has ever felt,
And it was then I saw that even the horizon of the universe in their obeisance knelt,

And now they live in each other,
In the eyes of the other and forever together!

And I hear the universe say, “this is true love of true lovers!”
Who now love each other in the night's secrets, and their twinkling covers!

As I leave the scene Irma, the night covers me too,
And I escape into the world that it creates exclusively for me and for you!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-love-quotes, inspiring-quotes, love-quotes, love-quotes-and-sayings, poems-about-love, quotations-on-love, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

"Love forever

She ran her fingers through her hair,
A smile appeared, and faded in her face somewhere,
Then as she lifted her eyebrows and she removed her freely falling hair,
In her eyes I found my desires and their brilliant glows, and in them I too existed somewhere,
Their charm immediately sieged me from everywhere,
And I began sinking into her sensation, her dreams and her eyes, and in it I sank somewhere,

Where my desires flowed unto her,
Now even my closed eyes only beheld her,
Her beauty had cast me in the crucible of love and its endless affair,
That exuded feelings invading my soul, and I fell in love with her,
With the glow in her eyes, with the smile that gradually submerges into her,
And makes me feel that I am endlessly being kissed by her,

I was engulfed by a veritable need to be with her forever,
To be her only thought about a true, and her only lover,
Whom she romances in the daylight and in the night’s dark cover,
A beautiful feeling from which she can part never,
A crescendo of joy that with every passing moment turns lovelier,
Creating a cohesion of two feelings which coexist in the cocoon of love forever,

She with me and I with her,
Where all desires before these two feelings surrender,
Creating a universe of love where my heart beats no longer whisper,
But beat loud and confess that they only beat for her,
And in return she too confesses, “I too will love you forever!”
And I cannot help falling in love everytime I see the smile gracefully covering her.","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-quotes, love, love-quotes, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

"What if and love

What if time develops a trait to forget,
What if light does not travel at all,
What if life turns into a ceaseless moment of regret,
And every perception of height begins to crumble and fall,

What will become of the memories then,
What will become of the darkness,
Shall we be restricted to lead a life in a den,
Where there is everything packed within feelings riddled with moments of nothingness,

What will become of the love you felt,
What will become of the faces you come across everyday,
Shall the feeling die suddenly that arose in your heart when you had met,
That special someone on that very special moment, on that wonderful someday,


Will days then be reduced to just a someday, just another day,
Will feelings flow like a river that does not know its course,
But overflows its banks because it just wants to flow anyway,
Will you be then frozen in moments of endless remorse,

Because time has forgotten its preceding moments,
Memories exist but for what the mind is unable to discern,
And you lead a life that thrives on strange supplements,
Of needless worries, and exceedingly needless concern,

What if time stole from her my all memories,
What will then remind her of me,
Will she then lead a life of endless comedies or never ending tragedies,
Because in the crowd when I pass by she fails to recognise me,

I wonder what it will be like when time becomes forgetful,
And light cannot travel anymore,
Maybe I would choose to live in sublime moments deeply thoughtful,
Where I will only think of you and nothing else no more,

Then I will let time forget everything,
And let light not travel at all,
It cannot steal from me your memories because except you and your memories there is nothing,
And then both time and light shall in the abyss of your memories fall,

Where both will now only recognise you and bear your signatures,
And ah, my joy to see you then appear everywhere,
And I can barely wait to see light bearing your beauty’s textures,
While Irma my love, time spreads your memories everywhere!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspirational-quotes, inspiring-quotes, life-quotes, life-sayings, love, love-quotes, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0
"As I loved

It was a moment of inner strife,
Where everything clashed with every force of life,

The feelings shielded the heart,
The memories protected the mind with an inimitable art,

And in this brutal battle I was caught,
Everything appeared flawed and with follies fraught,

Heart was beating to please the feelings,
And the mind dwelled on memories in its secret dealings,

But whatever their acts might have been,
They both were desperately trying to keep alive her beauty that they had once felt and seen,

And I let them indulge in their acts,
Because my heart through the memories of the mind was actually safeguarding its love pacts,

Made many decades ago,
But their authenticity and their freshness it could not forgo,

And I knew both of them were willingly caught in this situation,
Because it was their only possible means to offer me some emotional restoration,

So that they could live as I lived,
So that they felt loved as I loved!

And they both silently quoth, “we love her,”
And I openly said, “I love you because you love her!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-quotes, life, life-poems, life-quotes, love, love-quotes, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

"Lover's experience

Felt, but not heard,
Experienced, but not rumpus,
Her every love kissed word,
That is often about us,

When she utters it,
Her eyes speak it,
My heart hears it,
While my mind helplessly flirts with it,

Always offered, but never demanded,
Invested, but never lost,
These are the moments of love by her commanded,
That keep us away from the time’s frost,

And when I am felt by them,
These infinite moments of love, I feel I live for them,
Because often it feels I live through them,
As she smiles at me through all of them,

Always accepted and never denied,
Always expected and never unwelcome,
Her wishes and desires united,
That my heart and mind always welcome,

"Beauty and stone

In the huge town square,
A statue carved from stone witnessed every passer by,
And wondered how it could similar movements acquire,
So that it too could walk if not fly,

Its eyes constantly looked at the strange faces,
Its posture was always the same,
It stood at just one place and it could never visit other places,
For it had sacrificed everything in the static beauty’s name,

That is still, motionless, feelingless and always the same,
It even perceives different things with single perception of mind,
Cursed to play over and over again the same game,
Because for the statue-like beauty everything is predefined,

The posture, the view, the stance, and I guess even its every thought,
At least that is how I feel when I look at the statue placed in the main town square,
It seems to seek what it since eternity has sought,
Because it may bear a fixed expression, but that has nothing to do with its desire,

Because it expresses what its sculptor felt,
And in this crowded town square it looks the same every night, everyday and every time,
Of its own sweet will it has never with anything dealt,
It has witnessed many lovers’ kisses, and it has been witness to many a crime,

But it is its irony to be a statue and nothing else,
Beautiful to look at and admire,
But it has a missing pulse,
That of real, warm, sensitive and sensate beauty in its prime,

So, I sometimes look at it and just pretend it noticed me,
As I leave the spot, I see it unmoved and feelingless,
To it nothing matters, who you are or who you wish to be,
Because it is just beauty carved from stone, completely lifeless,

And then my love I think of you, and I miss you,
So I leave the statue and its stone carved beauty behind,
Because the statue is beautiful, but it cannot be you,
Therefore, instead in my memories and in my heart beats you I discover and always manage to find!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-love-quotes, inspiring-quotes, love, love-quotes, poems-about-love, quotations-on-love, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

Believe that a farther shore
Is reachable from here.

And cures and healing wells.

Double-take of feeling.
If there’s fire on the mountain
And lightning and storm
And a god speaks from the sky

Of new life at its term.

That justice can rise up

"Pool of memories

Like a dry flower petal that flies in the air,
Feeling it belongs to the sky,
I find her memories floating in my mind everywhere,
Whether I am thinking of her or in a vacant state of my mind I lie,

The memory, her memory, drifts from one neuron to another,
Until it settles where all her memories lie piled up,
And then these fragments and bits of memories condole each other,
And they all say together, “Hey you amorous soul, never give up!”

And all these memories rise and spread across my mind,
Hitched to every thought that arises from my cerebral thinking,
Though they think of now and sometimes of the future, eventually with her imaginations they all bind,
And in this pool of memories, now, time appears to be sinking,

So it doesn't matter whether it was yesterday or it is today,
Because I have been granted my wish,
That to lie immersed in her thoughts everyday,
In this pool of her memories the only fish,

That swims across it,
Feeds on it, and lives in this pool,
And then begins the true wonder of it,
The wonder of the romantic pool,

Where she assumes the form of every drop of memory,
And like a fish I swim and dive into her soul freely,
In a love’s own nursery,
Where I love her and romance her freely!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","best-quotes-and-sayings, hope, inspiring-quotes, love, love-quotes, quotes-on-hope, scifi-romance-quotes",0

A silver lining is not the same as being in denial or having rose-colored glasses. It is the ability to find hope amid darkness, to see possibility where others see despair. Being an optimist can be a challenging mindset to maintain in moments of negativity. For this reason, those with the space to envision the silver linings must do so.

"Second Confrontation With The Limp.

Today while ascending the escalators,
In the crowd of thousands of spectators,
The limp appeared once again,
With similar signature of pain and strain,
And the drag with which he pulled his right foot,
Today seemed shorter than half a foot,
He appeared to be moving in a definite direction,
Without any doubts or dereliction,
As I was ascending the escalator,
He was descending the stairs one at a time , like a helpless procrastinator,
And there I caught a glimpse of human emotion,
A feeling of surging and pristinely humane sensation,
A man who must have been in his mid sixties and ascending the escalator beside me,
With side parted grey hair and a composed look that even skies longed to see,
Caught the sight of the limp holding his bag in his left hand,
While he held his right leg with his right hand and pushed it to the next step, to maintain balance and anyhow stand,
He descended the stairs with caution, one step at a time,
And the left leg, was in complete denial to rhyme,
With the floundering right foot supported by his ankle high shoes,
But there was nothing to cover or hide his face bearing the painful blues,
The man looked at him and turned to see him again and again,
Then without making it obvious, he removed his spectacles and cleared his tears, as he revived his look simple and plain,
But it seemed he missed a heart beat when he saw the man limping in the crowd,
A rush of emotion crossed him and surged his existence and for anyone equally sensitive, it was silent yet very loud,
His feelings of sympathy were displayed all over his face,
The sadness that he managed to hide with a synthetic grace,
Failed in preventing him to constantly turn his head and look at the limping man,
Perhaps it reminded him of someone dear or he felt a fellow human beings pain culminating in the form of the limping man,
And he quietly wept and maybe felt deeply sorry for the limp and his relentless dragging,
For whatever reason the limp too turned and looked back, and both were locked in a momentary emotional tugging,
Where the limp gently smiled and bowed a bit,
The man tried to smile too but he couldn't, so he lifted his hand slowly and waved it at him, as if to tell him, keep walking, never stop or sit,
And then both pursued, rather were lured by their destinies,
One ascending, the other one descending, with their own dreams, own hopes and a bunch of certainties,
The man must be where he ought to be, the limp too might be at his destination now,
But today both of them conquered their destinies with that humbling and simple bow!","Javid Ahmad Tak,","encouragement-quotes, encouraging-quotes, hope, hope-quotes, hopeful-and-encouraging, inspirational, inspirational-quotes, life-quotes",0

"Bilba nodded and headed to Syrath, climbing onto his back with Fili behind her.

They lifted off, the ground falling away behind them and she leaned against Fili, mentally picturing the final shards of the shell she'd built around herself falling away below her.

She was neither the naïve girl she'd been before her mother's death or the well of never-ending hate she'd been after.

She was Bilba, the daughter of Belladonna Took and Dwalin, son of Fundin.

She was Orcrist, Orc Cleaver, protector of the weak and defenseless.

She was the rider of Syrath, the partner and One of Fili, son of Vili, Crown Prince of Erebor.

She was her father's daughter and her mother's light.

She was more than what the orcs had tried to make her, more than what she'd made herself and more than the false foundations upon which she'd built her life.

She would rebuild again and, this time, it wouldn't be on the false hope of a fictional father she'd created in her mind and it wouldn't be on the twisted lie given to her by hate.

It would be based on truth, on what Fili and Syrath saw in her, what she was just starting to see in herself and what she saw when she looked at her father.

It would be based on allowing people in, not shutting them out.

And, this time, her foundation would be unshakable.","ISeeFire,","badass-hobbits, hope, love, vision, vulnerability, wholeness",0

Where people take care of each other and feel empowered to be their truest selves.

National PTSD Awareness Month

Suicide is as an axe to a tree,
a commitment to a delusional freedom,
that you have not yet learned to be freed,
when indeed you can set yourself free
by doing little or as much as needed
to care for you in the state of hopelessness,
and when you are one of the seeds
prematurely fell from the tree
that you need to find your ground
to grow among the forest.

Living is a passage to an endless potential of tomorrow
that your worth is not bounded by the society’s narrow values,
but you strike with the principles that preserve your worthiness
to find your pathway to meet the ultimate goal of happiness.

"Lifting from Depression


In the state of depression
feeling miserable, a statement undermining
all the potential harms when
self-worth knocking no mercy found,
hopelessness shadowing the self-worth
finding the false identity, absence from feeling
the way to feel.
Once depression sinking to the deepest state
of oppressing state, risking life
to mark the fault answer to end everything.


The depressed mood clouding the thinking mind,
impairing the judgement looking at life,
depressed mood, a desperate cry in mental despair,
when the reality of life is much brighter
than the state of depressing mood.
The reality of life is a hopeful life.


False sense of hopelessness,
a correctable state of the mind when do you
realized this? Disconfirming the strong false belief
of hopelessness is a way to go.
Depressed state of the mind can be lifted
with psychiatric care and psychotherapeutic help.
An early call to psychiatrist is the way to help,
and the loved ones offer emotional support
a good way to help, receiving help
the answer to redefining the state of the mind.


When adequate help arrives lifting from depression,
the depressed dark cloud lifted
from the state of depressed mind and you can clearly
see and move forward with what is in front of you.
Life backs into the living force,
keep on moving at will, living a full life
with life moving forward with all at will.

"TIME: The Long Journey

It occurred to me that a life well lived takes courage to tell...

When one sees beyond knowing there is no beginning and no end, only an undeniable presence of something greater than self.

We understand the greater self is God.

Sometimes, I feel, God presents us with sorrow to show us there is hope for tomorrow.

When you touch another soul all souls unite and live as one spirit alive in the universe.

God blesses us in unseen ways daily. The time we share is our history.

Your endearing journey touches lives needing the love only you can give.

Wintertime nighs;
But my bereavement-pain
It cannot bring again:
Twice no one dies.

Flower-petals flee;
But, since it once hath been,
No more that severing scene
Can harrow me.

Birds faint in dread:
I shall not lose old strength
In the lone frost's black length:
Strength long since fled!

Leaves freeze to dun;
But friends can not turn cold
This season as of old
For him with none.

Tempests may scath;
But love can not make smart
Again this year his heart
Who no heart hath.

But death will not appal

Waits in unhope.","Thomas Hardy,","death, grief, hope, loss, poetry, sorrow, winter",2

"Man and society are resurrected every moment in the act of hope and of faith in the here and now; every act of love, of awareness, of compassion is resurrection; every act of sloth, of greed, of selfishness is death. Every moment existence confronts us with the alternatives of resurrection or death; every moment we give an answer. This answer lies not in what we say or think, but in what we are, how we act, where we are moving.","Erich Fromm,","death, decision, hope, life, resurrection",0

"Let's remember why you started reading this guide. You wanted hope for your home. Unfortunately, hope isn't as ambiguous as it sounds. It isn't something that floats around in the sky until it settles on the top of your head.
It's something you work for, it's something you discover after you put in some work. And really, that's not unfortunate! Unfortunate things are out of your control.","Dana K. White,",hope,0

"Grandpapa and even Artis's friends believed that New Dawn was the most dangerous thing in their world. But Artis knew that wasn't true. Hope was. Having too much, having too little. Trying to work out that invisible balance so you don't get crushed but also don't float away was labor Artis didn't always feel strong enough to do. It hurt too much to hope sometimes. Better to just be, take whatever comes as gracefully as you can, 'cuz it's coming anyway, whether you want it or not.","Janelle Monáe,",hope,0
"Each week day I dropped the girls off to school at eight am, then worked solidly until I collected them from afterschool club at five-thirty, often returning to the Longing once they were in bed. I enjoyed Finn’s conversational tour of Lòn Haven, and occasionally his death metal tapes. Here, on Lòn Haven, I was untethered from the past. Everything I’d carried for the last fifteen years – the shock of my pregnancy with Saffy, the grief at losing Sean, and now, that terrifying phone call – was gobbled up by the ravenous tide. And witnessing the Longing transform, stroke by stroke, into something a little less knackered, its former glory beginning to creep back, was rewarding. I felt that, maybe, I could start again, too.",C J Cooke,"death-metal, future, hope, parenting, past, present, the-lighthouse-witches",0
